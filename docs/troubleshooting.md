# First-Run Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers the most common problems new users encounter when setting up and running Wanaku for the first time. Issues are grouped by category and ranked by how likely you are to hit them.

For operational troubleshooting (authentication errors, tool invocation failures, performance tuning), see the [Troubleshooting section in the Usage Guide](usage.md#troubleshooting).

## Authentication and Keycloak

### Router rejects all requests when Keycloak is unreachable

**Symptoms:**

- Router starts but management, admin, and MCP endpoints return HTTP 401
- Health check at `/q/health/ready` reports OIDC as DOWN

**Why this happens:**

Authentication is enabled by default (`wanaku.http.auth=keycloak` in `application.properties`). If Keycloak is not running or unreachable at the configured `auth.server` URL, the router starts but cannot validate tokens, so all authenticated endpoints reject requests.

**Fix:**

Either start Keycloak first, or disable authentication entirely:

```shell
# Option 1: Use the noauth docker-compose
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose-noauth.yml up

# Option 2: Set environment variable
export WANAKU_HTTP_AUTH=none

# Option 3: Set system property
java -Dwanaku.http.auth=none -jar wanaku-barn-backend-runner.jar
```

### No human user account exists in Keycloak

**Symptoms:**

- Keycloak login page appears but you have no username/password
- Admin UI and CLI authentication fail

**Why this happens:**

The realm import (`deploy/auth/wanaku-config.json`) creates the realm structure and a service account, but no human user. However, self-registration is enabled in the realm configuration.

**Fix:**

Either register a new account or create one manually:

1. **Self-register:** Navigate to the Keycloak login page and click "Register" to create a new account
2. **Manual creation:** Go to the Keycloak admin console at `http://localhost:8543/admin` (login: `admin`/`admin`), select the `wanaku` realm, navigate to Users, and create a new user with a password

### Downstream MCP servers fail to authenticate to the router

**Symptoms:**

- MCP server logs show repeated 401 errors during registration
- Registration retries exhaust and the service gives up silently

**Why this happens:**

The capabilities SDK ships with a placeholder OIDC client secret: `quarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret=<insert key here>`. This is a syntactically valid but non-functional value. When authentication is enabled, downstream MCP servers need a real client secret to obtain bearer tokens for communicating with the router.

**Fix:**

Set the OIDC client secret as an environment variable on each downstream MCP server:

```shell
# Use the default secret from docker-compose, or your actual Keycloak secret
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_SECRET=mypasswd
```

For unauthenticated mode, set `WANAKU_HTTP_AUTH=none` on both the router and all downstream MCP servers.

### CLI commands return 401 Unauthorized

**Symptoms:**

- All `wanaku` CLI commands fail with authentication errors
- No clear indication that login is required

**Why this happens:**

When the router has authentication enabled, the CLI requires an active session. The CLI does not prompt for login automatically.

**Fix:**

```shell
# Log in against Keycloak with the client oauth2-proxy accepts (wanaku-mcp-router)
export WANAKU_CLIENT_SECRET=<wanaku-mcp-router secret>
wanaku auth login \
  --auth-server http://localhost:8543 \
  --realm wanaku \
  --username alice \
  --password

# Then target the management proxy, not the backend port
wanaku tools list --host http://localhost:4181

# For routers running without authentication, use --no-auth
wanaku tools list --no-auth
```

### CLI commands fail with: An error occurred: Failed to communicate with Keycloak

**Symptoms:**

- `wanaku` CLI commands fail to communicate with Keycloak

Example:

```shell
An error occurred: Failed to communicate with Keycloak at https://127.0.0.1:8543

Run with --verbose flag for more details

```

If you set `--verbose` and then shows the cause as:

```shell
sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

**Why this happens:**

The security code (JSSE) in wanaku-cli doesn't recognize the certificate that serves the Keycloak HTTPS endpoint.

**Fix:**

You have two options:

- You can skip the certificate checks in wanaku-cli by using the `--insecure` parameter. In this case, it will show a warning `WARNING: TLS certificate verification is disabled. This is insecure and should only be used for development.`.

- You can use the CA that signed the Keycloak HTTPS endpoint, by either importing it into the default Java truststore `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` or have a particular keystore file and use the `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore` and `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` parameters to refer to this custom truststore.

NOTE: You can set these `-D` to the wanaku-cli as in this example:

```shell
java "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=my-truststore.p12" "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit" -jar quarkus-run.jar  admin credentials show --admin-username=admin --admin-password=admin --keycloak-url=https://keycloak.192.168.49.2.nip.io --show-secret --client-id wanaku-service
```

### Token issuer mismatch causes 401 on OpenShift / Kubernetes

**Symptoms:**

- External clients obtain tokens from Keycloak and send them to the router
- The router rejects all tokens with HTTP 401
- Keycloak and the router are both running, and the realm is configured correctly

**Why this happens:**

When Keycloak is accessed via an external route (e.g. `http://keycloak-wanaku-test.<cluster>/realms/wanaku`), tokens are stamped with that route URL as the issuer. The router, however, validates tokens against the internal service URL (`http://keycloak:8080/realms/wanaku`). Because the issuers don't match, every token is rejected.

**Fix:**

Set `KC_HOSTNAME` on the Keycloak deployment to match the external route or ingress host. This forces Keycloak to stamp the same issuer in all tokens regardless of how it is accessed:

```shell
# OpenShift
KEYCLOAK_HOST=$(oc get route keycloak -n "${WANAKU_NAMESPACE}" -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
oc set env deployment/keycloak \
  KC_HOSTNAME="${KEYCLOAK_HOST}" \
  -n "${WANAKU_NAMESPACE}"

# Kubernetes (use the Ingress host instead)
KEYCLOAK_HOST=$(kubectl get ingress keycloak -n "${WANAKU_NAMESPACE}" -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].host}')
kubectl set env deployment/keycloak \
  KC_HOSTNAME="${KEYCLOAK_HOST}" \
  -n "${WANAKU_NAMESPACE}"
```

The `deploy/auth/keycloak.yaml` manifest includes a `KEYCLOAK_HOST` placeholder for `KC_HOSTNAME` — replace it with your actual hostname before applying. See also the [Keycloak setup test plan](../tests/plans/common/keycloak-setup.md) for the full automated procedure.

### Browser shows "502 Bad Gateway" after sign in from Keycloak

**Symptoms:**

When you access Wanaku web console with authentication enabled, it redirects to Keycloak for authentication, then after you input the username and password, it redirects back to Wanaku with the `502 Bad Gateway` error in the browser page.
If you are using nginx as loadbalancer you can verify if it logs this message `upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream`.

```shell
kubectl -n ingress-nginx logs deploy/ingress-nginx-controller|grep upstream
```

**Why this happens:**

Nginx `proxy-buffer-size` [defaults to 4k or 8k](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffer_size), so you have to increase it.

**Fix:**

You have to change the nginx configuration to a larger buffer size.
There is this patch command to change the configuration value. In this example it increases the value to 16k.

```shell
kubectl -n ingress-nginx patch cm/ingress-nginx-controller --type=merge -p '{"data": {"proxy-buffer-size": "16k"}}'
```

## MCP Server Registration

### Downstream MCP servers start but don't appear in the router

**Symptoms:**

- MCP server starts successfully and passes health checks
- The admin UI shows no registered services
- Service logs show warnings like `Unable to register service because of: Connection refused`

**Why this happens:**

The registration URI defaults to `http://localhost:8080` via the `@WithDefault` annotation in `WanakuServiceConfig`. This works when the router runs on the same host, but fails in Docker, Kubernetes, or multi-host setups. After 12 failed retries (approximately 60 seconds), the service gives up permanently with no re-registration mechanism.

**Fix:**

Set the registration URI to the router's actual address:

```shell
export WANAKU_SERVICE_REGISTRATION_URI=http://<router-host>:8080/
```

Ensure the router is started and healthy before starting downstream MCP servers. In Docker Compose, use `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`.

### MCP server registers but router cannot call it back

**Symptoms:**

- Capability appears in the admin UI
- Tool invocations fail with connection timeouts
- Router logs show connection errors to an unexpected IP address

**Why this happens:**

The `announce-address` configuration defaults to `auto`, which picks the first non-loopback network interface. In Docker, this is often an internal bridge IP. In multi-NIC environments, it may select a VPN tunnel interface.

**Fix:**

Explicitly set the announce address to an IP the router can reach:

```properties
# In the MCP server's application.properties
wanaku.service.registration.announce-address=<reachable-ip>
```

## Docker Compose and Deployment

### Docker Compose does not work on macOS with Podman

**Symptoms:**

- Services fail to start or cannot communicate with each other

**Why this happens:**

All services in the provided `docker-compose.yml` use `network_mode: host`, which is not supported on macOS with Podman (see [podman#15664](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15664)).

**Fix:**

Use Docker Desktop on macOS instead of Podman, or modify the compose file to use bridge networking with explicit port mappings.

### Router health check is silently ignored in docker-compose.yml

**Symptoms:**

- MCP servers start before the router is ready
- Registration fails due to race conditions
- Startup succeeds on retry but is unreliable

**Why this happens:**

In `deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`, the `healthcheck:` block for the router is at the wrong YAML indentation level. It appears as a top-level key rather than nested under the `wanaku-router` service, so Docker Compose ignores it entirely.

**Fix:**

If you experience startup race conditions, add a delay before starting MCP servers, or fix the indentation in your local copy of the compose file so the healthcheck is nested under the `wanaku-router` service definition.

### Insecure default credentials in docker-compose

**Symptoms:**

No error, which is the problem. The provided docker-compose ships with well-known credentials.

**Why this happens:**

The development docker-compose uses default credentials for convenience:

- Keycloak admin: `admin` / `admin`
- OIDC client secret for `wanaku-service`: `mypasswd`

**Fix:**

Before any non-local deployment, rotate these credentials:

1. Change `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the compose file
2. Update the `wanaku-service` client secret in Keycloak
3. Update `QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_SECRET` on all downstream MCP servers to match

## SDK and MCP Server Development

### Port 8080 conflict between router and new MCP servers

**Symptoms:**

- `java.net.BindException: Address already in use` when starting an MCP server alongside the router

**Why this happens:**

MCP servers often default to port 8080, which is the same as the router.

**Fix:**

Set a non-conflicting port in the MCP server's `application.properties`:

```properties
# Use a specific port
quarkus.http.port=9090

# Or let Quarkus pick a random available port
quarkus.http.port=0
```

## Frontend and Admin UI

### CORS errors when frontend runs on a non-default port

**Symptoms:**

- Browser console shows CORS preflight failures
- API calls from the frontend are blocked

**Why this happens:**

The router's CORS allowlist is configured for specific origins: `localhost:8080`, `127.0.0.1:8080`, `localhost:5173`, and `localhost:6274`. If Vite's dev server runs on a different port (which happens automatically when 5173 is already in use), requests are blocked.

**Fix:**

Add your dev server's origin to the router's configuration:

```properties
# In apps/wanaku-barn-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
quarkus.http.cors.origins=http://localhost:8080,http://127.0.0.1:8080,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:6274,http://localhost:<your-port>
```

## Performance

### Opaque "Generic error" responses

**Symptoms:**

- API responses contain only `{"error": "Generic error"}` with HTTP 500
- No indication of what went wrong

**Why this happens:**

The router's `BaseExceptionMapper` catches all unhandled exceptions and returns a sanitized error message. The actual exception details are logged server-side but not exposed in the API response.

**Fix:**

Check the router's server logs for the real stack trace:

- **Dev mode:** `target/logs/wanaku.log`
- **Docker:** `docker logs <container-name>`
- **Kubernetes:** `kubectl logs <pod-name>`

Enable debug logging for more detail:

```properties
quarkus.log.category."ai.wanaku".level=DEBUG
```

## System-Level Issues

### Module access errors on Java 25

**Symptoms:**

- `wanaku --version` or any `wanaku` command fails immediately with `IllegalAccessError`, `InaccessibleObjectException`, or a stack trace mentioning `java.base/java.lang` module access
- Running with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED'` resolves the error

**Why this happens:**

Java 25 tightened strong encapsulation of internal JDK classes. Some dependencies used by Quarkus and the CLI attempt reflective access to `java.lang` internals that are no longer automatically open.

**Fix:**

The Wanaku CLI and router scripts already pass `--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED` by default on Java 25. If you run the JAR directly (e.g., `java -jar quarkus-run.jar`), add the option manually:

```shell
java --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED -jar quarkus-run.jar --version
```

If you still encounter module access errors for other packages, add the corresponding `--add-opens` or `--add-exports` flag. Report the full stack trace as a new issue so we can extend the launcher defaults.

### Infinispan data directory permissions in containers

**Symptoms:**

- Router fails at startup with file permission errors
- Persistence data is silently lost between restarts

**Why this happens:**

The Infinispan data directory defaults to `${wanaku.home}/router/`. In container images, this resolves to `/home/jboss/.wanaku/router/`. Running the container with a different UID or mounting a host directory with incompatible permissions causes Infinispan's `SoftIndexFileStore` to fail.

**Fix:**

Use named Docker volumes (which handle permissions automatically) rather than host-mounted directories. If you must use host mounts, ensure the directory is owned by UID 185 (the `jboss` user in the container image).

### Multiple router replicas have independent state

**Symptoms:**

- Changes made on one router instance (tool registrations, resource additions) are not visible on other instances
- Inconsistent behavior depending on which replica handles the request

**Why this happens:**

Infinispan is configured in `LOCAL` cache mode. Each router instance maintains its own isolated data store. There is no replication or synchronization between instances.

**Fix:**

Currently, Wanaku supports single-instance deployments only. Running multiple replicas requires architectural changes to enable distributed Infinispan cache modes. For high availability, use a single replica with persistent storage.

### Crashed MCP servers are not detected for up to 60 seconds

**Symptoms:**

- An MCP server crashes but tool calls to it continue failing for about a minute before the router marks it as unhealthy

**Why this happens:**

The router's periodic health check runs every 60 seconds (`wanaku.router.health-check.interval-seconds=60`). Between checks, the router assumes previously registered MCP servers are still healthy.

**Fix:**

Reduce the health check interval for faster detection (at the cost of increased network traffic):

```properties
wanaku.router.health-check.interval-seconds=15
```
