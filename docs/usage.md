# Introduction

Wanaku aims to provide unified access, routing and resource management capabilities for your organization and your AI Agents.

## Understanding What Is Wanaku

The Wanaku MCP Router is an integration service designed to securely connect AI agents with various enterprise systems and cloud services.
It acts as a central hub that manages and governs how agents access specific resources and tools, effectively proxying and
filtering capabilities exposed to Large Language Models (LLMs).

The Wanaku MCP Router itself does not directly host tools or resources; instead, it acts as an integration service that connects AI agents with external resources and tools, including enterprise systems and cloud services. It manages and governs access between agent types and specific resources, proxying and filtering available capabilities to agents and their LLM

![Diagram showing Wanaku's layered architecture with LLM client connecting to router backend, which communicates with tool services and resource providers](imgs/wanaku-architecture.jpg)

Wanaku provides specialized services, referred to as "capabilities" that offer specific functionalities to the Wanaku MCP Router.

These capabilities enable communication with various systems, such as Kafka services, message brokers, cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google, etc.),
databases and a wide range of enterprise systems, including Workday and Salesforce, without directly containing the tools or resources.

Furthermore, Wanaku features an MCP-to-MCP bridge, which allows it to act as a centralized gateway or proxy for other MCP servers
that use HTTP as the transport mechanism. This capability enables Wanaku to aggregate and effectively "hide" multiple external MCP
servers, simplifying management and increasing the overall functionality of a Wanaku instance. Wanaku is an open-source project and is licensed under Apache 2.0.

### Meet Wanaku

If you haven't seen it already, we recommend watching the Getting Started with Wanaku video that introduces the project,
and introduces how it works.

[![Getting Started With Wanaku](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-fuNAo2j4SA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fuNAo2j4SA)

> [!NOTE]
> Also check the Getting Started from the [demos repository](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku-demos/tree/main/01-getting-started).

## Using Wanaku

Using Wanaku MCP Router involves two key actions:

1. Forwarding other MCP servers via the MCP forwarder
2. Adding new capabilities via downstream services

Tools and resources are provided by MCP servers registered with the router. When you add an MCP server,
its tools and resources become automatically available to agents using Wanaku.

### Forwarding other MCP servers via the MCP forwarder

Wanaku can act as a central gateway or proxy to other MCP servers that use HTTP as the transport mechanism.
This feature allows for a centralized endpoint to aggregate tools and resources provided by other MCP servers, making them
accessible as if they were local to the Wanaku instance.

### Adding new capabilities via downstream services

This refers to extending the router's functionality by integrating with various external systems.

Wanaku leverages Quarkus and Apache Camel to provide connectivity to a vast range of services and platforms.
This allows users to create custom services to solve particular needs.
These services can be implemented in any language that supports the Wanaku communication protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> It is also possible to create and run services in Java and other languages, such as Go or Python, although the process is not
> entirely documented at the moment.

# Preparing the System for Running Wanaku

Security in Wanaku involves controlling access to the management APIs and web interface while ensuring that only authorized
users can modify tools, resources, and configurations. Wanaku also ensures secure access to the MCP tools and resources.

Wanaku uses [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) for authentication and authorization. A Keycloak instance is required when running
Wanaku with authentication enabled. This section covers the basics of getting Keycloak ready for Wanaku for development and
production purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Wanaku can also run **without authentication** by setting `wanaku.http.auth=none`. This is useful for local development,
> testing, or air-gapped environments where an identity provider is not available. See
> [Running Without Authentication](#running-without-authentication) for details.

## Keycloak Setup for Wanaku

Choose the setup that matches your environment.

- **Local Development:** Use Podman for a quick, local instance.
- **OpenShift Deployment:** Follow these steps for a cluster environment.

### Option 1: Local Setup with Podman

This method is ideal for development and testing on your local machine.

#### Starting the Keycloak Container

First, run the following command in your terminal to start a Keycloak container.
This command also sets the initial admin credentials and maps a local volume for data persistence.

```shell
podman run -d \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8543:8080 \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  -v keycloak-dev:/opt/keycloak/data \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.7 start-dev
```

- `-p 127.0.0.1:8543:8080`: Maps port `8543` on your local machine to the container's port `8080`. By default, Wanaku expects Keycloak on port `8543`.
- `-e ...`: Sets the default **admin** username and password. Change the password for any non-trivial use case.
- `-v keycloak-dev...`: Creates a persistent volume named `keycloak-dev` to store Keycloak data.

### Option 2: Deploying to OpenShift or Kubernetes

If you are deploying Wanaku in OpenShift or Kubernetes, you can follow these steps to get an entirely new Keycloak setup up and
running.
If you already have a Keycloak instance, you may skip the deployment section and jump to importing the realm.

#### Deploying Keycloak

Apply the pre-defined Kubernetes configurations located in the [`deploy/auth`](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/tree/main/deploy/auth) directory.
This will create all the necessary resources for Keycloak to run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before applying, review the files and be sure to change the default admin password for security.

```shell
NS=$(kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{..namespace}')
DOMAIN=$(oc get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}')
KC_HOST="keycloak-$NS.$DOMAIN"
cat deploy/auth/keycloak.yaml | sed "s/KEYCLOAK_HOST/https:\/\/$KC_HOST/"| kubectl create -f -
```

Expose the Keycloak service outside the cluster.

Note that the service is exposed with a self-signed certificate, for development purposes only.

- Minikube

```shell
cat deploy/auth/keycloak-ingress.yaml | sed "s/KEYCLOAK_HOST/keycloak.$(minikube ip).nip.io/"| kubectl create -f -
```

- OpenShift

```shell
kubectl apply -f deploy/auth/keycloak-router.yaml
```

### Importing the Wanaku Realm Configuration (via Wanaku CLI)

The simplest way to import the realm configuration is using the Wanaku CLI. You can set admin credentials once via environment variables:

```shell
export WANAKU_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export WANAKU_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
wanaku admin realm create
```

This imports the default realm configuration from `deploy/auth/wanaku-config.json`. You can specify a custom configuration file with `--config /path/to/realm.json` and a custom Keycloak URL with `--keycloak-url`.
Also, in case the keycloak server is in https with a self-signed certificate, then you have to import the realm config file with the Keycloak UI or execute the `deploy/auth/configure-auth.sh` script.

To get the keycloak server:

- Minikube : `echo "https://"$(kubectl get ingress keycloak -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].host}')`
- OpenShift: `echo "https://"$(kubectl get route keycloak -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')`

### Importing the Wanaku Realm Configuration (via Shell Script)

Alternatively, Wanaku comes with a [script that simplifies importing](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/blob/main/deploy/auth/configure-auth.sh)
the realm configuration into keycloak.

The script takes care to discover the Keycloak server address.
You can optionally customize the keycloak URL, user and password with the following environment variables:

- set the `WANAKU_KEYCLOAK_PASS` variable to the admin password of your Keycloak instance
- set `WANAKU_KEYCLOAK_HOST` to the address of your Keycloak instance (i.e.; `localhost` if using Podman). If in OpenShift or minikube, it already takes care to discover it.

### Importing the Wanaku Realm Configuration (via Keycloak UI)

Alternatively, you may also import the configuration using Keycloak's UI, and then proceed to regenerate the capabilities' client secret.

#### Regenerating the Capabilities' Client Secret

Finally, for security, you must regenerate the client secret for the `wanaku-service` client.

1. Navigate to the Keycloak Admin Console at `http://localhost:8543`.
2. Log in with your admin credentials (**admin**/**admin**).
3. Select the **wanaku** realm from the dropdown in the top-left corner.
4. Go to **Clients** in the side menu and click on **wanaku-service**.
5. Go to the **Credentials** tab.
6. Click the **Regenerate secret** button and confirm. Copy the new secret to use in your application's configuration.

![Screenshot of Keycloak admin console showing the wanaku-service client credentials tab with the Regenerate secret button](imgs/keycloak-service.png)

## Running Without Authentication

Wanaku can run without authentication by setting `wanaku.http.auth=none` (or `WANAKU_HTTP_AUTH=none` via
environment variable). This disables OIDC and permits access to all API endpoints, the admin UI, and MCP namespaces
without requiring a Bearer token or a Keycloak instance.

This is useful for:

- **Local development and testing** — no need to set up Keycloak
- **Air-gapped environments** — where an external identity provider is not available
- **Quick prototyping** — get started with Wanaku immediately

### Disabling Authentication

**Using the CLI (default for local):**

```shell
wanaku start local
```

The `wanaku start local` command automatically disables authentication, so no additional configuration is needed.

**Using an environment variable:**

```shell
export WANAKU_HTTP_AUTH=none
java -jar quarkus-run.jar
```

**Using a system property:**

```shell
java -Dwanaku.http.auth=none -jar quarkus-run.jar
```

**Using Docker Compose:**

A dedicated compose file is provided at `deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose-noauth.yml` that runs the router
without Keycloak:

```shell
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose-noauth.yml up
```

If you extend that compose file with capability services, set `WANAKU_HTTP_AUTH=none` on those services as well.

> [!WARNING]
> Running without authentication disables all access control. Do not use it in production environments where
> access control is required.

# Installing Wanaku

To run Wanaku, you need to first download and install the router and the command line client.

## Prerequisites

> **Important:** Java 21 or later is required to run Wanaku. Ensure you have Java 21+ installed before proceeding with the installation.

You can verify your Java version by running:

```shell
java -version
```

## Installing the Command Line Interface (CLI)

Although the router comes with a UI, the CLI is the primary method used to manage the router.
As such, it's recommended to have it installed.

### Installing the CLI by downloading binary

The most recommended method for installing the Wanaku CLI is to download the latest version directly from the
[release](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/releases) page on GitHub

#### Installing the CLI via JBang

To simplify using the Wanaku Command Line Interface (CLI), you can install it via [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/).

> **Note:** JBang requires Java 21 or later for running Wanaku CLI.

First, ensure JBang is installed on your system. You can find detailed [download and installation](https://www.jbang.dev/download/) instructions on the official JBang website.

After installing JBang, verify it's working correctly by opening your command shell and running:

```shell
jbang version
```

This command should display the installed version of JBang.

Next, to access the Wanaku CLI, install it using JBang with the following command:

```shell
jbang app install wanaku@wanaku-ai/wanaku
```

This will install Wanaku CLI as the `wanaku` command within JBang, meaning that you can run Wanaku from the command line by just
executing `wanaku`.

> [!NOTE]
> It requires access to the internet, in case of using a proxy, please ensure that the proxy is configured for your system.
> If Wanaku JBang is not working with your current configuration, please look to [Proxy configuration in JBang documentation](https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/jbang/latest/configuration.html#proxy-configuration).

### PATH Configuration

If you installed the Wanaku CLI using `get-wanaku.sh` or the native build (`make install`), it is placed in `$HOME/bin`. Many systems do not include `$HOME/bin` in the default `PATH`, so you may need to add it manually to avoid a "command not found" error when running `wanaku`.

To add `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` for the current session:

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

To persist this across sessions, add the line above to your shell configuration file:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

> **Note:** If you are using `zsh`, replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc`.
>
> [!TIP]
> The `get-wanaku.sh` script auto-detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release, verifies the checksum, and installs to `$HOME/bin`. You can override the install directory with `WANAKU_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin`.

Verify the installation:

```shell
wanaku --version
```

### Handling HTTPS connections

Wanaku CLI may connect to either Keycloak or Wanaku MCP server, if their HTTP endpoints are protected by a server certificate (TLS) you may choose to skip the certificate checks or use the CA (Certificate Authority) that issued them on the wanaku-cli so the client can check the server certificate.

1. In wanaku-cli you can skip the checks by using the `--insecure` parameter, and it's going to print a warning message about it.
2. You can use the CA that signed the Keycloak HTTPS endpoint, by either importing it into the default Java truststore `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` or have a particular keystore file and use the `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore` and `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` parameters to refer to this custom truststore.

NOTE: You can set these `-D` to the wanaku-cli as in this example:

```shell
java "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=my-truststore.p12" "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit" -jar quarkus-run.jar  admin credentials show --admin-username=admin --admin-password=admin --keycloak-url=https://keycloak.192.168.49.2.nip.io --show-secret --client-id wanaku-service
```

## Installing and Running the Router

There are three ways to run the router. They work similarly, with the distinction that some of them may come with more
capabilities by default — continue reading the documentation below for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production deployments with authentication, the router needs to be configured for secure access and control of its
> resources. Make sure you read the section [Securing the Wanaku MCP Router](#securing-the-wanaku-mcp-router) **before**
> running or deploying the router. For local development or testing, you can
> [run without authentication](#running-without-authentication).

### Installing and Running Wanaku Locally Using "Wanaku Start Local"

You can use the Wanaku CLI to start a small/simplified local instance. After downloading the CLI, simply run
`wanaku start local` and the CLI should download, deploy and start Wanaku with the main server, a file provider
and an HTTP provider.

```shell
wanaku start local
```

The local runner disables authentication by default, so **Keycloak is not required**. The router and all
capability services will start without authentication.

If that is successful, open your browser at <http://localhost:8080>, and you should have access to the UI.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the command line to enable more services by using the `--services` option. Use the `--help` to see the details.

#### Running with the Camel Integration Capability

The [Camel Integration Capability](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/camel-integration-capability) (CIC) lets you
expose Apache Camel routes as MCP tools. You can supply routes in two ways: from local YAML files or from a
service catalog.

**Using Camel route files:**

```shell
wanaku start local \
  --camel-routes file:///path/to/routes.camel.yaml \
  --camel-rules file:///path/to/rules.yaml
```

`--camel-routes` and `--camel-rules` must both be provided when using route files.

**Using a service catalog:**

```shell
wanaku start local \
  --service-catalog my-catalog \
  --service-catalog-system ftp
```

`--service-catalog` and `--service-catalog-system` must both be provided when using service catalogs.

> [!NOTE]
> The two modes are mutually exclusive — you can use route files **or** a service catalog, but not both at the same time.

The `--fail-fast` flag (enabled by default) causes the CIC to fail immediately if route loading encounters an
error. Disable it with `--fail-fast=false` if you want the service to start regardless.

When any CIC option is provided, the `camel-integration` service is automatically added to the launch list.

### Installing and Running Wanaku on OpenShift or Kubernetes Using the Wanaku Operator

The Wanaku Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Wanaku instances on Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.
It automates the creation and configuration of all necessary resources, making it the recommended approach for production deployments.

> [!NOTE]
> For comprehensive operator documentation including CRD field reference, deployment patterns, lifecycle management, Helm configuration, and troubleshooting, see the **[Kubernetes Operator Guide](operator.md)**.

#### Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**

- Kubernetes 1.27+ or OpenShift 4.12+
- `kubectl` or `oc` CLI, `helm` 3.x
- Keycloak instance (see [Keycloak Setup](#keycloak-setup-for-wanaku)) or plan to use `wanaku.http.auth=none` for development
- Wanaku container image (optional)

**Build the container image:**

You can build the container image and push it to a container registry, or use a pre-built image.

There is a pre-built image in `quay.io/wanaku/wanaku-barn-backend:latest`

**Install the operator:**

```shell
kubectl create namespace wanaku
helm install wanaku-operator ./apps/wanaku-operator/deploy/helm/wanaku-operator \
  --namespace wanaku \
  --set operatorNamespace=wanaku
```

**Deploy a router:**

```yaml
# wanaku-router.yaml
apiVersion: "wanaku.ai/v1alpha1"
kind: WanakuRouter
metadata:
  name: wanaku-dev
spec:
  auth:
    authServer: http://keycloak:8080
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f wanaku-router.yaml -n wanaku
kubectl wait wanakurouter/wanaku-dev --for=condition=Ready --timeout=120s
```

**Deploy capabilities:**

```yaml
# wanaku-capabilities.yaml
apiVersion: "wanaku.ai/v1alpha1"
kind: WanakuCapability
metadata:
  name: wanaku-capabilities
spec:
  auth:
    authServer: http://keycloak:8080
  secrets:
    oidcCredentialsSecret: wanaku-oidc-secret
  routerRef: wanaku-dev
  capabilities:
    - name: wanaku-http
      image: quay.io/wanaku/wanaku-tool-service-http:latest
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f wanaku-capabilities.yaml -n wanaku
kubectl wait wanakucapability/wanaku-capabilities --for=condition=Ready --timeout=120s
```

> [!TIP]
> Complete sample CRs are in [apps/wanaku-operator/samples](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/tree/main/apps/wanaku-operator/samples). For service catalog deployment via the operator, see the [Operator Guide](operator.md).

### Installing and Running Wanaku on OpenShift or Kubernetes (Manually)

It is also possible to manually run Wanaku on Kubernetes distributions, such as OpenShift,
without the operator. You can use the Helm chart directly:

1. Install the operator Helm chart:

   ```shell
   helm install wanaku-operator apps/wanaku-operator/deploy/helm/wanaku-operator --namespace <your-namespace>
   ```

2. Create and apply a `WanakuRouter` custom resource for your environment (see [`deploy/kubernetes/wanaku-router.yaml`](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/blob/main/deploy/kubernetes/wanaku-router.yaml) for an example)
3. Create and apply a `WanakuCapability` custom resource for your capabilities (see [`deploy/kubernetes/wanaku-capabilities.yaml`](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/blob/main/deploy/kubernetes/wanaku-capabilities.yaml) for an example)

### Configuring the Wanaku MCP Router

Wanaku is built on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and uses `application.properties` files for configuration. Each
component ships with built-in defaults, but you can override any property at runtime in three ways:

1. **External file**: place an `application.properties` in a `config/` directory next to the JAR
2. **System properties**: pass `-D<property>=<value>` on the command line
3. **Environment variables**: export the property name in uppercase with dots/hyphens replaced by underscores

For example, to change the HTTP port:

```shell
# Via system property
java -Dquarkus.http.port=9090 -jar wanaku-barn-backend-runner.jar

# Via environment variable
export QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090
java -jar wanaku-barn-backend-runner.jar
```

For the full list of available properties and more details on configuration precedence, see the
[Configuration Guide](configurations.md).

### Accessing the Administration Web User Interface

Wanaku also comes with a web user interface that you can access to manage the router. By default it runs on port 8080 of
the host running the router.

> [!NOTE]
> At this moment, some features are only available on the CLI.

When accessing the Web UI for the first time, you will be redirected to the Keycloak instance for login. Create a user
and define a password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wanaku does not yet support fine-grained access control. All authenticated users have admin access to
> tools and resources. Expect this to change in future versions.

## Installing and Running Capabilities

Capabilities are standalone services that connect to the Wanaku router to provide new functionalities.
They can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/releases),
deployed to OpenShift using the [operator](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/tree/main/apps/wanaku-operator) and [containers](https://quay.io/organization/wanaku)
or built from source.

To run a capability, you need to configure it to connect to your Wanaku router instance and authenticate with it.
This is done by setting a few essential properties.

### Configuring Capabilities

You can configure capabilities using environment variables, system properties on the command line, or by placing an
`application.properties` file in a `config/` directory next to the capability JAR (see the
[Configuration Basics](configurations.md#configuration-basics) section for details on how Quarkus loads configuration).

Here are the key properties you need to set:

1. Router URI: Each capability needs to know where the Wanaku router is located to register itself.

    ```properties
    wanaku.service.registration.uri=http://localhost:8080
    ```

2. OIDC Client Credentials: Capabilities authenticate with the router using OIDC. You must provide the client secret that you previously regenerated in Keycloak.

    ```properties
    quarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret=your-client-secret-from-keycloak
    ```

3. Announce Address (Optional): If the capability is running in an environment where its address is not directly accessible by the router (e.g., behind a NAT or in a container), you need to specify the address that the router should use to communicate back to it.

    ```properties
    wanaku.service.registration.announce-address=your-public-address
    ```

> [!TIP]
> You can check the full set of [configuration](configurations.md) available.

### Running a Capability

Once configured, you can run the capability from the command line. The following example shows how to run a capability while overriding the configuration properties:

```shell
java -Dwanaku.service.registration.uri=http://<wanaku-router-host>:8080 \
     -Dquarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret=<your-client-secret> \
     -Dwanaku.service.registration.announce-address=<your-public-address> \
     -jar <capability-jar-file>.jar
```

> [!NOTE]
> Each capability may have its own specific set of configurations. For example, the [Camel Integration Capability for Wanaku](https://wanaku.ai/docs/camel-integration-capability/)
> requires additional properties to connect to different systems.
> Always consult the specific documentation for the capability you are using for more details.

### Running Archetype-Generated Capabilities Locally (No Authentication)

Capabilities scaffolded with `wanaku services create tool` or `wanaku services create resource` include OIDC authentication by default. When running against a local router in `noauth` mode, the capability fails at startup because it tries to contact a non-existent Keycloak server. To run locally without authentication, reaugment the capability to disable OIDC, then start it:

```shell
java -Dquarkus.launch.rebuild=true -Dquarkus.oidc-client.enabled=false -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

Then start normally (adjust port and router URL as needed):

```shell
java -Dquarkus.http.port=9010 -Dwanaku.service.registration.uri=http://localhost:8080 -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

This reaugmentation step is only needed once per build. The augmentation layer change persists until the next `mvn clean package`.

#### Prerequisites

Before deploying Wanaku on OpenShift, ensure you have:

- Access to an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster
- `oc` or `kubectl` CLI tools configured
- Sufficient permissions to create deployments, services, and routes

#### Initial Setup Steps

#### Deployment

You can deploy Wanaku on OpenShift or Kubernetes using the operator Helm chart.

After having deployed Keycloak, then run the following command to get its route:

```shell
kubectl get route keycloak -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
```

Then install the operator and apply the custom resources with your OIDC configuration:

```shell
helm install wanaku-operator apps/wanaku-operator/deploy/helm/wanaku-operator --namespace <your-namespace>

sed -e "s/oidc-url-replace/<your-keycloak-url>/g" \
     deploy/kubernetes/wanaku-router.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

sed -e "s/oidc-url-replace/<your-keycloak-url>/g" \
    -e "s/replace-me-with-the-client-credentials-secret/<your-client-secret>/g" \
     deploy/kubernetes/wanaku-capabilities.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Environment Configuration

When running Wanaku on OpenShift or Kubernetes, capabilities cannot automatically discover the router address.
You must configure the router location using environment variables in your deployment:

- Set `WANAKU_SERVICE_REGISTRATION_URI` to point to the actual location of the router
- Configure OIDC authentication URLs to point to your Keycloak instance

The operator handles these configurations automatically when using `WanakuRouter` and `WanakuCapability` custom resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This configuration is also required when running the router and the services on different hosts.

# Securing the Wanaku MCP Router

Security in Wanaku involves controlling access to the management APIs and web interface while ensuring that only authorized
users can modify tools, resources, and configurations.

This section covers how to configure Wanaku for secure access.

> [!NOTE]
> Authentication and authorization currently apply only to the management APIs and UI, not to the MCP endpoints themselves.
> This feature is experimental and under active development.

## Understanding Wanaku Security Model

Wanaku's security model focuses on:

- **API Protection**: Securing management operations for tools, resources, and configuration
- **UI Access Control**: Restricting access to the web console
- **Service Authentication**: Ensuring capability services can authenticate with the router
- **MCP Authentication**: Ensuring MCP calls are authenticated

### MCP Authentication

Currently, Wanaku supports:

- OAuth authentication with code grant
- Automatic client registration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the Automatic client registration, the access is granted per-namespace. As such, applications need to request a new
> client id and grant if they change the namespace in use.

For these to work, Keycloak needs to be configured so that the authentication is properly supported.

Wanaku comes with a [template configuration](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/blob/main/deploy/auth/wanaku-config.json) that
can be imported into Keycloak to set up the realm, clients and everything else needed for Wanaku to work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After importing this, make sure to adjust the secrets used by the services and any other potential sensitive configuration.

### Configuring an MCP Client for OIDC

When connecting an MCP client application to Wanaku, you need to configure it with the correct OIDC client ID and scopes.
By default, the Wanaku Keycloak realm provides the following settings for MCP clients:

- **Client ID**: `mcp-client`
- **Scopes**: `openid`, `wanaku-mcp-client`

When an application uses these settings to connect to a Wanaku MCP endpoint, the user will be redirected to the
Keycloak login page. After entering their username and password, Keycloak will redirect them back to the application
with a valid authentication token.

> [!NOTE]
> If using automatic client registration, the registered client will use these same defaults. Applications only need
> to request a new client ID and grant when changing the namespace in use.

## Configuring Wanaku Components for Secure Access

Each Wanaku component requires a specific set of configurations for secure access. You can find the full set of
configuration options in the [Configuration Guide](configurations.md).

The configuration varies depending on the component's role in the system.

### Wanaku Router Backend Security Configurations

The backend service handles API operations and requires [OIDC configuration](https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-configuration-properties-reference)
with service credentials.
Some of the configurations you may need to change are:

```properties
# Address of the Keycloak authentication server - adjust to your Keycloak instance
auth.server=http://localhost:8543
# Address used by the OIDC proxy -
auth.proxy=http://localhost:${quarkus.http.port}

# Client identifier configured in Keycloak for the backend service
quarkus.oidc.client-id=wanaku-mcp-router

# Avoid forcing HTTPS
quarkus.oidc.resource-metadata.force-https-scheme=false
```

- [Secure MCP SSE Server](https://quarkus.io/blog/secure-mcp-sse-server/)

### Capability Services Security Configurations

Wanaku also requires for the capabilities services to be authenticated in order to register themselves.
Capability services act as [OIDC clients](https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect-client-reference) and authenticate
with the router using client credentials.
Some of the settings you may need to adjust are:

```properties
# Address of the Keycloak authentication server - adjust to your Keycloak instance
auth.server=http://localhost:8543

# Keycloak realm name - adjust to your Keycloak realm (default: wanaku)
auth.realm=${AUTH_REALM:wanaku}

# Address of the Keycloak authentication server
quarkus.oidc-client.auth-server-url=${auth.server}/realms/${auth.realm}

# Client secret from Keycloak for service authentication - replace with your actual secret
quarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret=aBqsU3EzUPCHumf9sTK5sanxXkB0yFtv
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Capability services use the OIDC *client* component (`quarkus.oidc-client.*`), which differs from the main router configuration
> - The client secret values shown here are examples from the default configuration - replace them with your actual Keycloak client secrets
> - Ensure the auth-server-url points to your actual Keycloak instance

### Encrypting Secrets at Rest

Wanaku supports AES-256 encryption for secrets stored in files. When enabled, all secrets provisioned by tools and resources
are encrypted before being written to disk and automatically decrypted when read.

To enable secret encryption, set both environment variables:

```shell
export WANAKU_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD="your-strong-password"
export WANAKU_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_SALT="unique-salt-value"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Both password and salt must be set for encryption to work
> - All services that handle secrets must use the same password and salt values
> - Store credentials securely (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault)

<!-- -->

> [!WARNING]
> If the encryption password or salt is lost, encrypted secrets cannot be recovered. Ensure these values are backed up securely.

For more details, see the [Configuration Guide](configurations.md#secret-encryption).

# Using the Wanaku MCP Router

## Protocol Support

Wanaku supports MCP via SSE (deprecated) or via Streamable HTTP.

The MCP endpoint exposed by Wanaku can be accessed on the path `/mcp/sse` of the host you are using (for instance, if running
locally, that would mean `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse`).

The Streamable HTTP endpoint can be accessed on the path `/mcp/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Also make sure to check the details about namespaces, as Wanaku offers different namespaces where MCP Tools and MCP
> Resources can be registered. This is documented further ahead in this guide.

## CLI Authentication

The Wanaku CLI supports authentication to securely interact with the Wanaku MCP Router API. Authentication credentials are stored locally and automatically included in API requests.

### Authentication Modes

The CLI currently supports the following authentication modes:

- **token** (default): Use an API token for authentication via Bearer token
- **username** and **password**

### Authentication Commands

#### Login

Store authentication credentials for use with subsequent CLI commands:

```shell
wanaku auth login --api-token <your-api-token>
```

**Options:**

- `--api-token <token>`: API token for authentication
- `--auth-server <url>`: Authentication server URL (optional)
- `--username <username>`: Username for password-based login
- `--password <password>`: Password for password-based login (interactive)
- `--realm <realm>`: Keycloak realm for direct Keycloak authentication (optional; when omitted, uses the router OIDC proxy)
- `--client-id <client-id>`: OAuth2 client ID (default: `admin-cli`)
- `--mode <mode>`: Authentication mode - `token` or `oauth2` (default: `token`)

**Discovery URL behavior:**

- When `--realm` is provided, the CLI constructs a Keycloak-native OIDC discovery URL: `<auth-server>/realms/<realm>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- When `--realm` is omitted (or blank), the CLI falls back to the Wanaku router OIDC proxy path: `<auth-server>/q/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- This allows `wanaku auth login` to work directly against a Keycloak instance (e.g. `--auth-server http://keycloak-host --realm wanaku`) as well as through the router's OIDC proxy.

**Example:**

```shell
wanaku auth login --api-token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

With custom authentication server:

```shell
wanaku auth login \
  --api-token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... \
  --auth-server https://keycloak.example.com \
  --mode token
```

With username/password directly against Keycloak:

```shell
wanaku auth login \
--auth-server http://keycloak-host \
--realm wanaku \
--username alice \
--password
```

With username/password through the router's OIDC proxy:

```shell
wanaku auth login \
--auth-server http://localhost:8080 \
--username alice \
--password
```

#### Status

Check the current authentication status and view stored credentials:

```shell
wanaku auth status
```

This command displays:

- Current authentication mode
- Masked API token (showing first and last 4 characters)
- Authentication server URL (if configured)
- Masked refresh token (if available)
- Credentials file location
- Whether credentials are currently stored

**Example output:**

```text
Authentication Status:
=====================
Mode: token
API Token: eyJh***VCJ9
Auth Server: https://keycloak.example.com
Credentials File: /Users/username/.wanaku/credentials
Has Credentials: true
```

#### Logout

Clear all stored authentication credentials:

```shell
wanaku auth logout
```

This command removes all authentication data from the local credentials file.

#### Token Management

Manage the stored authentication token:

```shell
wanaku auth token --get
```

By default, `--get` masks the token value. Use `--unmask` to print the full token:

```shell
wanaku auth token --get --unmask
```

You can also set or clear the stored token directly:

```shell
wanaku auth token --set <token>
wanaku auth token --clear
```

### Using Authentication with Commands

Once authenticated via `wanaku auth login`, all subsequent CLI commands will automatically include the authentication token in their requests.

#### Per-Command Token Override

You can override the stored authentication token for a single command:

```shell
wanaku tools list --token <temporary-token>
```

#### Disabling Authentication

To explicitly disable authentication for a command:

```shell
wanaku tools list --no-auth
```

### Credential Storage

By default, credentials are stored in:

```text
~/.wanaku/credentials
```

You can override this path with the `WANAKU_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to isolate credentials across contexts or concurrent sessions:

```shell
export WANAKU_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/my-isolated-credentials
wanaku auth login --api-token <token>
```

This is useful when running multiple test plans or sessions in parallel, as it prevents token overwrites that would otherwise occur in the shared global file.

The credentials file is a Java properties file containing:

- `api.token`: The API bearer token
- `refresh.token`: OAuth2 refresh token (when applicable)
- `auth.mode`: The authentication mode (token, oauth2, etc.)
- `auth.server.url`: The authentication server URL

> [!CAUTION]
> The credentials file contains sensitive authentication tokens. Ensure proper file permissions are set to prevent unauthorized access.
> On Unix-like systems, you should restrict access: `chmod 600 ~/.wanaku/credentials`

### Authentication Flow

The CLI authentication process works as follows:

1. **Login**: User provides API token via `wanaku auth login --api-token <token>`
2. **Storage**: Token is stored in `~/.wanaku/credentials`
3. **Auto-Injection**: The CLI automatically reads the token and adds it as a Bearer token to the `Authorization` header for all API requests
4. **Validation**: The Wanaku Router validates the token on each request
5. **Logout**: User can clear credentials via `wanaku auth logout`

### Troubleshooting Authentication

#### Token Not Working

If you receive authentication errors:

1. Check token validity:

   ```shell
   wanaku auth status
   ```

2. Verify the token hasn't expired
3. Ensure you're using the correct authentication server URL
4. Try logging in again with a fresh token

#### Clear and Reset

To completely reset authentication:

```shell
wanaku auth logout
wanaku auth login --api-token <new-token>
```

#### Manual Credential Management

You can manually edit or remove the credentials file if needed:

```shell
# View credentials
cat ~/.wanaku/credentials

# Remove credentials manually
rm ~/.wanaku/credentials
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Token Protection**: Never share your API tokens or commit them to version control
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate tokens periodically for enhanced security
3. **Use Environment Variables**: For CI/CD, consider using `--token` flag with environment variables instead of storing tokens
4. **File Permissions**: Ensure credentials file has restricted permissions (600)
5. **Logout When Done**: Use `wanaku auth logout` when finished working on shared systems

### Example Workflows

#### Basic Authentication Workflow

```shell
# Login with API token
wanaku auth login --api-token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# Verify authentication
wanaku auth status

# Use authenticated commands
wanaku tools list
wanaku resources list
wanaku data-store list

# Logout when done
wanaku auth logout
```

#### CI/CD Usage

For automated scripts, use token override instead of storing credentials:

```shell
# Use token from environment variable
wanaku tools list --token $WANAKU_API_TOKEN

# Or disable authentication for public endpoints
wanaku tools list --no-auth
```

## Admin Commands

The `wanaku admin` command group provides Keycloak administration operations for managing realms, users, and service client credentials. These commands authenticate directly against Keycloak using admin credentials rather than the user's stored token.

### Common Options

All admin commands share the following options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--admin-username` | Admin username for Keycloak (required unless `WANAKU_ADMIN_USERNAME` is set) | |
| `--admin-password` | Admin password for Keycloak (required unless `WANAKU_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set, interactive) | |
| `--keycloak-url` | Keycloak server URL | `http://localhost:8543` |
| `--realm` | Keycloak realm to manage | `wanaku` |

If you prefer not to pass admin credentials on every command, set them once in your environment:

```shell
export WANAKU_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export WANAKU_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
wanaku admin users list
```

### User Management

```shell
# List all users in the realm
wanaku admin users list --admin-username admin --admin-password admin

# Create a new user (email, first-name, last-name are optional and default to username-based values)
# By default, the email is marked as verified (equivalent to passing --verified).
# Use --no-verified to leave it unverified, but note that emailVerified must be true
# for OIDC login to succeed; otherwise Keycloak returns "account_not_fully_set_up"
# and the CLI throws ServiceAuthException: Account is not fully set up.
wanaku admin users add --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --username alice --password secretpass \
  --email alice@example.com --first-name Alice --last-name Smith

# Create a user with an unverified email
wanaku admin users add --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --username bob --password secretpass --no-verified

# Remove a user
wanaku admin users remove --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --username alice

# Set a user's password
wanaku admin users set-password --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --username alice --password newpass
```

### Service Client Credential Management

```shell
# List service clients (filters out internal Keycloak clients)
wanaku admin credentials list --admin-username admin --admin-password admin

# Create a new service client
wanaku admin credentials add --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --client-id my-service --description "My service client"

# Create a service client and display its secret
wanaku admin credentials add --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --client-id my-service --show-secret

# Show an existing client's secret
wanaku admin credentials show --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --client-id my-service --show-secret

# Regenerate a client's secret
wanaku admin credentials regenerate --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --client-id my-service --show-secret

# Remove a service client
wanaku admin credentials remove --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --client-id my-service
```

> **Note:** The `--show-secret` flag is required to display client secrets. Without it, `credentials show` will print a warning instead. Use with caution as secrets may leak into logs or shell history.

### Realm Management

```shell
# Import the default realm configuration (deploy/auth/wanaku-config.json)
wanaku admin realm create --admin-username admin --admin-password admin

# Import a custom realm configuration file
wanaku admin realm create --admin-username admin --admin-password admin \
  --config /path/to/realm.json

# Import with a custom Keycloak URL
wanaku admin realm create --keycloak-url http://keycloak:8080 \
  --admin-username admin --admin-password admin
```

## Understanding Capabilities

Wanaku itself does not have any builtin MCP tool, resource or functionality itself. The router itself is just a blank MCP server.

To actually perform its work, Wanaku relies on specialized services that offer the connectivity bridge that enables Wanaku
to talk to any kind of service. At its core, Wanaku is powered by [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org), which provide the ability to connect
to more than [300 different types of systems and services](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/).

The power of Wanaku relies on its ability to plug in different types of systems, regardless of them being new
microservices or legacy enterprise systems.
For instance, consider the scenario of an enterprise organization, which is running hundreds of systems. With Wanaku,
it is possible to create a specific capability for each of them (i.e.: a capability for the finance systems, another
for human resources, another for billing, and so on).

The granularity on which these capabilities can operate is a decision left to the administrator of the system. For some
organizations, having a "Kafka" capability to Wanaku capable of talking to any of its systems may be enough. Others, may
want to have system-specific ones (i.e.: a billing capability, an employee system capability, etc).

The recommended way to create those capabilities is to use the [Camel Integration Capability for Wanaku](https://wanaku.ai/docs/camel-integration-capability/). This is a
subcomponent of Wanaku that leverages Apache Camel to exchange data with any system that Camel is capable of talking to.

![Diagram showing available Wanaku capability types including tool services, resource providers, and MCP server bridges](imgs/wanaku-capabilities.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> Capabilities were, at some point, also called "Downstream services" or "targets". You may still see that terminology
> used in some places, especially in older documentation.

You should see a list of capabilities available in the UI, in the Capabilities page. Something similar to this:

![Screenshot of Wanaku web UI showing a list of registered capability services with their status, type, and health information](imgs/capabilities-list.png)

On the CLI, running `wanaku capabilities list` lists the capabilities available for MCP tools:

```shell
service serviceType  host      port status lastSeen
exec    tool-invoker 127.0.0.1 9009 active Sat, Oct 18, 2025 at 18:47:22
http    tool-invoker 127.0.0.1 9000 active Sat, Oct 18, 2025 at 18:47:23
tavily  tool-invoker 127.0.0.1 9006 active Sat, Oct 18, 2025 at 18:47:23
```

Capabilities determine what type of tools you may add to the router. As such, in the output from the CLI above, it means that
this server can add tools of the following types: `exec`, `tavily`, and `http`.

Wanaku accepts the following capability service types:

- `tool-invoker`: these capabilities can be used to create MCP tools.
- `resource-provider`: these capabilities can be used to create MCP resources.
- `multi-capability`: these capabilities can be used to create either MCP tools or MCP resources.

## Managing MCP Tools

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to execute tasks beyond their inherent capabilities by
using external functions.
Each tool is uniquely identified by a name and defined with an input schema that outlines the expected parameters.
Essentially, MCP tools act as a standardized interface through which an AI agent can request information or execute specific
tasks from external systems, like APIs or databases.

Tools and resources are managed through MCP servers added to the router. When you register an MCP server,
its tools become available automatically. The CLI provides read-only commands for inspecting tools.

### Listing Tools

Any available tool is listed by default when you access the UI.

When using the CLI, the `wanaku tools list` command allows you to view all available tools on your Wanaku MCP Router instance.

Running this command will display a comprehensive list of tools, including their names and descriptions.

```shell
wanaku tools list
```

For example, you should receive an output similar to this.

```shell
Name               Type               URI
meow-facts      => http            => https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com?count={parameter.valueOrElse('count', 1)}
dog-facts       => http            => https://dogapi.dog/api/v2/facts?limit={parameter.valueOrElse('count', 1)}
```

### Showing Tool Details

The `wanaku tools show` command displays detailed information about a specific tool registered in the Wanaku MCP Router.

```shell
wanaku tools show <tool-name>
```

This command retrieves comprehensive details including the tool's name, namespace, type, description, URI, labels, and input schema properties.

**Example:**

```shell
wanaku tools show meow-facts
```

**Sample Output:**

```text
Tool Details:
name        meow-facts
namespace   default
type        http
description Retrieve random facts about cats
uri         https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com?count={parameter.valueOrElse('count', 1)}
labels      category=animals

Input Schema Properties:
name   type   description                    required
count  int    The count of facts to retrieve yes
```

**Options:**

- `--host <url>`: The API host URL (default: `http://localhost:8080`)

**Example with remote host:**

```shell
wanaku tools show --host http://api.example.com:8080 meow-facts
```

### Generating Tools

The `wanaku tools generate` command converts an OpenAPI specification into a collection of tool references
that can be used by an AI agent.

It parses and resolves OpenAPI paths and operations, transforming them into a standardized tool reference
format for HTTP services.

This command accepts an OpenAPI specification file (either as a local path or URL) and produces a JSON output containing
tool references.

Each operation in the API is converted to a tool reference with appropriate metadata, including the operation's name,
description, URI template, and input schema.

The command handles server variable substitution, proper formatting of path parameters according to the tool reference specification.

By default, the command uses the first server defined in the OpenAPI specification, but you can override this behavior by
specifying a different server URL or selecting a different server from the specification by index.

The generated output can be directed to standard output or saved to a file.

If the process completes successfully, the command returns exit code `0`. It returns exit code `3` if no paths are found in the
specification and exit code `2` if an error occurs during processing.

> [!NOTE]
> The command support both `json` and `yaml` definition:

For example:

```shell
wanaku tools generate http://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.yaml
```

If the spec defines a server url that contains variables

```yaml
servers:
  - url: 'https://{env}.domain.com/foo/{v1}/{v2}/{v3}'
    variables:
      env:
        description: Environment - staging or production
        default: stage-api
        enum:
          - stage-api
          - api
      # other variables
      # ...
```

Then, you can specify values as command parameters:

```shell
wanaku tools generate --server-variable env=prod --server-variable v1=first http://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

If not specified for a variable in the server URL template, the default value defined in the OpenAPI specification will be used.

It only applies when using servers from the OpenAPI specification (not when using `--server-url`).

Variables must be defined in the server object of the OpenAPI specification.

Empty or null values for either key or value will be ignored.

OpenAPI specifications can define multiple server URLs:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "description": "Production server"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://staging-api.example.com/v1",
      "description": "Staging server"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
      "description": "Local development server"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `--server-index` (or `-i`) option allows you to specify which server definition from the OpenAPI specification should be
used as the base URL for tool references.

```shell
wanaku tools generate -i 1 ./openapi-spec.yaml
```

This option is ignored if `--server-url` is specified, as an explicit URL overrides any server definitions in the
specification.

If neither `--server-index` nor `--server-url` is specified, the command will default to using the first server (index `0`)
from the specification.

The `--server-index` option can be used together with `--server-variable` when the selected server has variable templates:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://{environment}.api.example.com/{version}
    variables:
      environment:
        default: dev
      version:
        default: v1
  - url: https://{environment}.api2.example.com/{version}
    variables:
      environment:
        default: dev
      version:
        default: v1
  - url: https://{environment}.api3.example.com/{version}
    variables:
      environment:
        default: dev
      version:
        default: v1
```

You could select this server and override its variables:

```shell
wanaku tools generate -i 0 -v environment=prod -v version=v2 ./openapi-spec.yaml
```

The `--output-file` (or `-o`) option specifies the file path where the generated tool references should be written.

It determines where the output JSON containing all the tool references will be saved.

```shell
wanaku tools generate -o ./toolsets/api-tools.json http://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

If `--output-file` is specified, the command will write the JSON toolset to the specified file path.

If `--output-file` is not specified, the command will write the JSON toolset to standard output (STDOUT).

If the specified path is a directory, the command will write to a file named `out.json` within that directory and provide
a warning message.

If the specified file already exists, the command will return an error without overwriting the file.
The parent directory of the specified file must exist and be writable by the current user.

## Managing MCP Resources

Resources are managed through MCP servers added to the router. The CLI provides read-only commands for inspecting resources.

### Listing Resources

The wanaku resources list command allows you to view all resources currently exposed by your Wanaku MCP Router instance.

Executing this command will display a list of available resources, including their names and descriptions.

```shell
wanaku resources list
```

### Showing Resource Details

The `wanaku resources show` command displays detailed information about a specific resource registered in the Wanaku MCP Router.

```shell
wanaku resources show <resource-name>
```

This command retrieves comprehensive details including the resource's name, type, description, location, MIME type, namespace, labels, and parameters.

**Example:**

```shell
wanaku resources show q4-report
```

**Sample Output:**

```text
Resource Details:
name        q4-report
type        file
description Q4 Financial Report
location    /home/user/documents/report.pdf
mimeType    application/pdf
namespace   default
labels      category=finance, year=2024

Parameters:
name   value
key1   value1
key2   value2
```

**Options:**

- `--host <url>`: The API host URL (default: `http://localhost:8080`)

**Example with remote host:**

```shell
wanaku resources show --host http://api.example.com:8080 q4-report
```

## Managing MCP Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates that can leverage multiple tools and provide example interactions for LLMs. They are part of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) specification and enable:

- Creating standardized message templates with variable substitution
- Defining argument schemas for dynamic prompt generation
- Referencing tools that the prompt can utilize
- Supporting multiple content types (text, images, audio, embedded resources)
- Providing example interactions to guide LLM behavior

### Adding Prompts Using CLI

The `wanaku prompts add` command allows you to create new prompts in your Wanaku MCP Router instance.

#### Basic Example

```shell
wanaku prompts add \
  --name "code-review" \
  --description "Review code for quality and security issues" \
  --message "user:text:Please review the following code: {{code}}" \
  --message "assistant:text:I'll analyze this code for potential issues." \
  --argument "code:The code to review:true"
```

In this example:

- `--name "code-review"`: Assigns a unique identifier for the prompt
- `--description`: Provides a human-readable description
- `--message`: Defines messages in the prompt (can be specified multiple times)
- `--argument`: Defines template arguments (format: `name:description:required`)

#### Message Format

The `--message` option supports multiple content types:

**Text Messages** (default):

```shell
--message "user:text:Your message here"
--message "user:Your message here"  # Backward compatible shorthand
```

**Image Messages**:

```shell
--message "user:image:iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA...:image/png"
```

**Audio Messages**:

```shell
--message "user:audio:UklGRiQAAABXQVZFZm10IBAAAA...:audio/wav"
```

**Embedded Resource Messages**:

```shell
--message "user:resource:file:///path/to/file.txt:File content:text/plain"
```

#### Template Variable Substitution

Prompts support Mustache-style variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax:

```shell
wanaku prompts add \
  --name "translate" \
  --description "Translate text between languages" \
  --message "user:text:Translate the following text from {{source_lang}} to {{target_lang}}: {{text}}" \
  --argument "source_lang:Source language:true" \
  --argument "target_lang:Target language:true" \
  --argument "text:Text to translate:true"
```

#### Tool References

Prompts can reference specific tools they may utilize:

```shell
wanaku prompts add \
  --name "api-test" \
  --description "Test API endpoints" \
  --message "user:text:Test the API endpoint {{endpoint}}" \
  --tool-reference "http-get" \
  --tool-reference "http-post" \
  --argument "endpoint:API endpoint URL:true"
```

#### Namespace Support

Prompts can be organized into namespaces for isolation:

```shell
wanaku prompts add \
  --name "review" \
  --description "Code review prompt" \
  --namespace "ns-0" \
  --message "user:text:Review this code: {{code}}" \
  --argument "code:Code to review:true"
```

Supported namespaces: `ns-0` through `ns-9`, `default`, and `public`.

### Adding Prompts Using the UI

You can also manage prompts through the Wanaku Web UI:

1. Navigate to the Prompts page in the Web UI
2. Click "Add Prompt"
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Unique identifier for the prompt
   - **Description**: Human-readable description
   - **Messages (JSON)**: Array of message objects
   - **Arguments (JSON)**: Array of argument objects (optional)
   - **Tool References (JSON)**: Array of tool names (optional)
   - **Namespace**: Namespace for isolation (optional)

Example message JSON formats:

**Text Message**:

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Review {{code}}"
  }
}
```

**Image Message**:

```json
{
  "role": "user",

    }
  }
}
```

### Listing Prompts

View all prompts currently available in your Wanaku MCP Router instance:

```shell
wanaku prompts list
```

This displays all prompts with their names, descriptions, and namespaces.

### Editing Prompts

You can edit an existing prompt using the CLI.

The `wanaku prompts edit` command allows you to modify an existing prompt. Only the fields you specify will be updated:

```shell
wanaku prompts edit \
  --name "code-review" \
  --description "Updated description for code review" \
  --message "user:text:Please review this code: {{code}}"
```

All options except `--name` are optional:

- If `--description` is provided, it replaces the existing description
- If `--message` is provided, it replaces **all** existing messages
- If `--argument` is provided, it replaces **all** existing arguments
- If `--tool-references` is provided, it replaces **all** existing tool references
- If `--namespace` is provided, it replaces the existing namespace

Example of updating only the description:

```shell
wanaku prompts edit --name "code-review" --description "New description"
```

Example of updating messages:

```shell
wanaku prompts edit \
  --name "code-review" \
  --message "user:text:Review the following code for security issues: {{code}}" \
  --message "assistant:text:I'll perform a security audit."
```

### Removing Prompts

Remove a prompt by name:

```shell
wanaku prompts remove --name "code-review"
```

## Managing Shared Data

Wanaku provides a data store feature that allows you to share static data between Wanaku and its capabilities.

This is particularly useful for storing configuration files, route definitions, and other static resources that capabilities need to access at runtime.

A primary use case for the data store is storing Apache Camel routes and associated files for the Camel Integration Capability.

By storing route definitions in the data store, you can dynamically configure integrations without rebuilding or redeploying capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Authentication is required to access the data store API.
> Make sure you're logged in using `wanaku auth login` before using data store commands.

### Adding Data to the Data Store

The `wanaku data-store add` command allows you to upload files to the data store.
Files are automatically Base64 encoded when stored.

```shell
wanaku data-store add --read-from-file /path/to/file.yaml
```

By default, the data store entry will be named after the filename. You can specify a custom name using the `--name` option:

```shell
wanaku data-store add --read-from-file /path/to/employee-routes.camel.yaml --name employee-routes
```

In this example:

- `--read-from-file`: Specifies the local file path to upload
- `--name`: (Optional) Assigns a custom name to the stored data

The file contents are automatically Base64 encoded before being sent to the server, ensuring binary-safe storage.

### Listing Stored Data

View all data currently stored in the data store:

```shell
wanaku data-store list
```

This displays a table showing:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each stored item
- **Name**: The name of the stored data
- **Data**: A preview of the stored content (truncated to 50 characters)
- **Labels**: Labels associated with the data store entry

You can filter the list using label expressions:

```shell
# Filter by label expression
wanaku data-store list -e 'category=routes'
```

See the label expression guide (`wanaku man label-expression`) for detailed syntax information.

### Managing Labels on Data Stores

Data stores support labels for organization and filtering, similar to tools and resources.

**Adding labels to a data store:**

```shell
# Add labels to a specific data store by ID
wanaku data-store label add --id <data-store-id> --label category=routes --label env=production

# Add labels to multiple data stores using label expressions
wanaku data-store label add -e 'category=config' --label migrated=true
```

**Removing labels from a data store:**

```shell
# Remove labels from a specific data store by ID
wanaku data-store label remove --id <data-store-id> --label temporary --label draft

# Remove labels from multiple data stores using label expressions
wanaku data-store label remove -e 'status=deprecated' --label legacy
```

When adding a label with a key that already exists, the value will be updated. When removing a non-existent label, it will be silently ignored.

### Removing Data from the Data Store

Remove stored data using either the ID or name:

```shell
# Remove by ID
wanaku data-store remove --id <data-store-id>

# Remove by name
wanaku data-store remove --name employee-routes
```

> [!NOTE]
> The data store is also accessible via the REST API at `/api/v1/data-store` and through the Wanaku web interface under the Data Stores page,
> where you can upload, download, and manage stored data using a graphical interface.

## Managing Service Catalogs

Service catalogs provide a way to package, distribute, and deploy complete integration services to the Wanaku router. A service catalog bundles Camel routes, Wanaku rules, and optional dependencies into a single ZIP package that can be deployed as a unit. This is especially useful for teams that want to share pre-built integrations or automate the deployment of complex multi-route services.

For comprehensive documentation on service catalogs — including structure, CLI workflow, Kubernetes deployment, and REST API reference — see the [Service Catalogs Guide](service-catalogs.md).

### Quick Start

```shell
# 1. Initialize the catalog structure
wanaku service init --name=hr-system --services=employees,payroll

# 2. Edit the Camel routes
#    (modify hr-system/employees/employees.camel.yaml)
#    (modify hr-system/payroll/payroll.camel.yaml)

# 3. Generate rules from routes
wanaku service expose --path=hr-system

# 4. Deploy to the router
wanaku service deploy --path=hr-system --host=http://localhost:8080
```

See [Service Catalogs Guide](service-catalogs.md) for details on structure, packaging, operator deployment, and REST API usage.

> [!TIP]
> If you need parameterized, reusable service catalogs, see [Service Templates](service-templates.md) for details on creating and instantiating templates.

## Managing Capabilities

Configurations in Wanaku have two distinct scopes:

1. Capability service configurations
2. Tool definition configurations

### Capability Service Configurations

These configurations are essential for setting up the capability provider itself.

This includes details required for the transport mechanism used to access the capability, such as usernames and passwords for
authenticating with the underlying system that provides the capability.

Each capability service may have its own specific set of configurations. As such, check the capability service documentation
for details.

### Tool Definition Configurations

These configurations are specific to individual tools that leverage a particular capability. They include:

- Names and identifiers that differentiate tools using the same capability, like specific Kafka topics or the names of database tables.
- Operational properties that dictate how the tool behaves, such as the type of HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`), or operational settings like timeout configurations and idempotence flags.

These configurations are handled when adding a new tool to Wanaku MCP Router.

> [!NOTE]
> Check the "Configuring the Capabilities" section for additional details about this.

### Listing Capabilities

The `wanaku capabilities list` command provides a comprehensive view of all service capabilities available in the Wanaku Router.
It discovers and displays both management tools and resource providers, along with their current operational status and
activity information.

The command combines data from multiple API endpoints to present a unified view of the system's capabilities in an
easy-to-read table format.

The command displays the results in a table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **service** | Name of the service |
| **serviceType** | Type/category of the service |
| **host** | Hostname or IP address where the service runs |
| **port** | Port number the service listens on |
| **status** | Current operational status (`active`, `inactive`, or `-`) |
| **lastSeen** | Formatted timestamp of last activity |

For instance, running the command, should present you with an output similar to this:

#### Sample Output

![Terminal output showing the result of running 'wanaku capabilities list' command displaying registered capability services](imgs/cli-capabilities-list.png)

### Displaying Service Capability Details

The `wanaku capabilities show` command lets you view detailed information for a specific service capability within the
Wanaku MCP Router.

This includes its configuration parameters, current status, and connection information.

```bash
wanaku capabilities show <service> [--host <url>]
```

- `<service>`: The service name to show details for (e.g., http, sqs, file)
- `--host <url>`: The API host URL (default: <http://localhost:8080>)

When you execute the command, Wanaku displays comprehensive details about the chosen service type.
If multiple instances of the same service exist, an interactive menu will appear, allowing you to select the specific instance
you wish to view.

For example, to show the details for the HTTP service:

```shell
wanaku capabilities show http
```

Or, show details for SQS service linked with to a specific Wanaku MCP router running at `http://api.example.com:8080`:

```shell
wanaku capabilities show sqs --host http://api.example.com:8080
```

The command displays two main sections:

1. **Capability Summary**: Basic service information in table format:

- Service name and type
- Host and port
- Current status
- Last seen timestamp

1. **Configurations**: Detailed configuration parameters:

- Parameter names
- Parameter descriptions

![Terminal output showing detailed information for a specific capability service including status, URI, and available operations](imgs/capabilities-show.png)

#### Interactive Selection

When multiple instances of the same service are found, you'll see:

- A warning message indicating multiple matches
- An interactive selection prompt with service details
- Choose your desired instance using arrow keys and Enter

![Terminal output showing an interactive prompt for selecting a capability service from a numbered list](imgs/capabilities-show-choose.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Wanaku CLI provides clear exit codes to indicate the outcome of a command:
>
> - `0`: The command executed successfully.
> - `1`: An error occurred (e.g., no capabilities were found, or there were issues connecting to the API).

## Accessing Other MCP servers (MCP Forwards)

The MCP bridge in Wanaku allows it to act as a central gateway or proxy to other MCP servers that use HTTP as the transport mechanism.

This feature enables a centralized endpoint for aggregating tools and resources provided by other MCP servers.

### Listing Forwards

To view a list of currently configured forwards, use the `wanaku forwards list` command:

```bash
wanaku forwards list
```

This command displays information about each forward, including its name, service URL, and any other relevant details.

This can be useful for managing and troubleshooting MCP server integrations.

### Adding Forwards

To add an external MCP server to the Wanaku instance, use the `wanaku forwards add` command:

```bash
wanaku forwards add --service="http://your-mcp-server.com:8080/mcp/sse" --name my-mcp-server
```

- `--service`: The URL of the external MCP server's SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint.
- `--name`: A unique human-readable name for the forward, used for identification and management purposes.
- `--namespace` / `-N` (required): The namespace name to associate the forward with (e.g., `public`, `default`). The CLI resolves the name to its UUID automatically.
- `--namespace-id` (alternative to `--namespace`): The namespace UUID to use directly, for scripting or when the UUID is already known.

Use `--namespace` for the common case (human-readable name), or `--namespace-id` when scripting with known UUIDs. These options are mutually exclusive.

Once a forward is added, all tools and resources provided by the external MCP server will be mapped in the Wanaku instance.

These tools and resources can then be accessed as if they were local to the server.

### Removing Forwards

To remove a specific external MCP server from the Wanaku instance, use the `wanaku forwards remove` command:

```bash
wanaku forwards remove --name my-mcp-server
```

- `--name`: The human-readable name for the forward to be removed.

> [!WARNING]
> Forward removal operations cannot be undone. Once removed, the tools and resources from those MCP servers will no longer be accessible.

<!-- -->

> [!NOTE]
> Attempting to remove a non-existent forward will result in an error message.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have two MCP servers: `http://mcp-server1.com:8080/mcp/sse` and `http://mcp-server2.com:8080/mcp/sse`.

To integrate these external MCP servers into your Wanaku instance, follow these steps:

1. Add the first forward using the `wanaku forwards add` command:

```shell
wanaku forwards add --service="http://mcp-server1.com:8080/mcp/sse" --name mcp-server-1
```

1. Use the `wanaku forwards list` command to confirm that the forward has been successfully added:

```bash
wanaku forwards list
```

1. Verify that all tools and resources from `mcp-server1` are now accessible within your Wanaku instance using `wanaku tools list`

```shell
Name               Type               URI
tavily-search-local => tavily          => tavily://search?maxResults={parameter.value('maxResults')}
meow-facts      => mcp-remote-tool => <remote>
dog-facts       => mcp-remote-tool => <remote>
camel-rider-quote-generator => mcp-remote-tool => <remote>
tavily-search   => mcp-remote-tool => <remote>
laptop-order    => mcp-remote-tool => <remote>
```

1. Add the second forward using the same command:

```bash
wanaku forwards add --service="http://mcp-server2.com:8080/mcp/sse" --name mcp-server-2
```

1. Confirm that tools and resources from both external MCP servers are now integrated into your Wanaku instance (use `wanaku tools list`)
2. Use the `wanaku forwards list` command to view the updated list of forwards:

```bash
wanaku forwards list
```

By leveraging the MCP bridge feature, you can create a centralized endpoint for aggregating tools and resources from multiple
external MCP servers, simplifying management and increasing the overall functionality of your Wanaku instance.

## Managing Namespaces

Wanaku introduces the concept of namespaces to help users organize and isolate tools and resources, effectively managing the
Large Language Model (LLM) context. This prevents context bloat and improves the efficiency of your Wanaku deployments.

### What Are Namespaces

Namespaces provide a mechanism to group related tools and resources.

Each namespace acts as a separate logical container, ensuring that the LLM context for tools within one namespace does not
interfere with tools in another.
This is particularly useful when you have a large number of tools or when different sets of tools are used for distinct purposes.

Wanaku provides a fixed set of 10 available slots for namespaces, named from `ns-0` to `ns-9`.
It also provides a `default` namespace,
which is used if none is specified and a special `public` namespace that can be accessed without any authentication.

### Using Namespaces

Tools and resources are associated with namespaces through the MCP servers that provide them.

Wanaku automatically associates namespace names with available numerical slots from ns-0 to ns-9.

All commands that accept `--namespace` (`-N`) also support `--namespace-id` for passing the namespace UUID directly. These options are mutually exclusive. Use `--namespace-id` when scripting with known UUIDs.

### Checking Namespace Assignments

You can verify which namespace a tool or resource has been assigned to by using the `wanaku namespaces list` command.

This command will display a list of all active namespaces, their unique IDs, and their corresponding paths.

The output will look similar to this:

```shell
id                                   name   path
28560e66-d94c-44a2-b032-779b5542132a        http://localhost:8080/ns-4/mcp/sse
43b5d7a7-4e7d-4109-960b-ac7695b6f2d3 public http://localhost:8080/public/mcp/sse
93c5bfdf-0e09-4da5-82fa-4eec3bf6b1b4        http://localhost:8080/ns-3/mcp/sse
bfd112d2-32cb-475a-9f55-63301519152b        http://localhost:8080/ns-7/mcp/sse
f5915650-4daa-4616-95c6-5aafceffb026        http://localhost:8080/ns-1/mcp/sse
db89fedd-ffe6-4dee-b051-bcd5285bb9c9        http://localhost:8080/ns-2/mcp/sse
d4249e11-9368-4c5b-bb66-981d2d2e69c7        http://localhost:8080/ns-0/mcp/sse
8898fab6-3774-427f-8400-8c6f6fd9a97e        http://localhost:8080/ns-6/mcp/sse
fe8cc1f2-2355-4009-ba68-4faeefe937f7        http://localhost:8080/ns-5/mcp/sse
a3dfaaf6-3655-4bcc-8c48-3d183b6d675b        http://localhost:8080/ns-8/mcp/sse
8832e2c7-3bd9-4f9b-88ba-982cc20a43de        http://localhost:8080/ns-9/mcp/sse
<default>                                   http://localhost:8080//mcp/sse
```

In this output, you can see the mapping of internal namespace IDs to their corresponding ns-X paths.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Streamable HTTP, remove the `/sse` from the path (i.e.: `http://localhost:8080/ns-1/mcp/`).

### The Default Namespace

If you do not specify a namespace when adding a tool or resource, it will automatically be added to the default namespace.

The default namespace acts as a general container for tools that don't require specific isolation.

You can identify the default namespace in the wanaku namespaces list output by its `<default>` name.

### Managing Labels on Namespaces

Labels provide a flexible way to organize and filter namespaces. You can add metadata to namespaces in the form of key-value pairs, making it easier to manage and query them.

#### Adding Labels to Namespaces

You can add labels to an existing namespace using the `wanaku namespaces label add` command.

To specify which namespace to add labels to, you need the namespace ID from the `wanaku namespaces list` output (the first column):

```shell
# Add a single label to a namespace
wanaku namespaces label add --id 28560e66-d94c-44a2-b032-779b5542132a --label env=production

# Add multiple labels at once
wanaku namespaces label add --id 28560e66-d94c-44a2-b032-779b5542132a -l env=production -l tier=backend -l version=2.0
```

If a label key already exists, its value will be updated to the new value.

#### Adding Labels to Multiple Namespaces

You can add labels to multiple namespaces at once using label expressions:

```shell
# Add a label to all namespaces matching a label expression
wanaku namespaces label add --label-expression 'category=internal' --label migrated=true

# Add multiple labels to namespaces matching complex expressions
wanaku namespaces label add -e 'env=staging & tier=backend' -l reviewed=true -l compliant=yes
```

#### Removing Labels from Namespaces

To remove labels from a namespace, use the `wanaku namespaces label remove` command:

```shell
# Remove a single label from a namespace
wanaku namespaces label remove --id 28560e66-d94c-44a2-b032-779b5542132a --label env

# Remove multiple labels at once
wanaku namespaces label remove --id 28560e66-d94c-44a2-b032-779b5542132a -l env -l tier -l version
```

#### Removing Labels from Multiple Namespaces

Similar to adding labels, you can remove labels from multiple namespaces using label expressions:

```shell
# Remove labels from all namespaces matching an expression
wanaku namespaces label remove --label-expression 'category=temp' --label temp

# Remove multiple labels from matching namespaces
wanaku namespaces label remove -e 'migrated=true' -l temp -l draft
```

#### Listing Namespaces with Label Filters

You can filter namespaces by their labels when listing them:

```shell
# List all namespaces with a specific label
wanaku namespaces list --label-filter 'env=production'

# List namespaces matching complex expressions
wanaku namespaces list --label-filter 'env=production & tier=backend'
```

See the [Label Expressions Guide](LABEL_EXPRESSIONS.md) for detailed information on the label expression syntax and advanced filtering options.

## Shell Completion

Wanaku provides shell completion support for bash and zsh, enabling tab-completion for all commands, subcommands, and their options. This significantly improves the command-line experience by reducing typing and helping discover available commands and options.

### Generating Completion Scripts

To generate a completion script, use the `wanaku completion generate` command:

```shell
# Generate completion script and output to stdout
wanaku completion generate

# Save completion script to a file
wanaku completion generate --output ~/.wanaku_completion
```

The generated script includes completion support for:

- All parent commands (namespaces, tools, resources, forwards, capabilities, etc.)
- All subcommands (namespaces label add, tools list, etc.)
- All command options (--help, --verbose, --plain, command-specific options)
- Automatic detection of bash vs zsh shell

### Quick Setup for Current Session Only

If you want to enable completion for just your current terminal session without making permanent changes:

```shell
# One-liner for bash or zsh (works on both Linux and macOS)
source <(wanaku completion generate)

# Alternative using eval (also works on both bash and zsh)
eval "$(wanaku completion generate)"
```

This generates and immediately sources the completion script in your current shell. Completion will be active until you close the terminal, without creating any files or modifying your shell configuration files.

This is useful for:

- Testing completion before permanent installation
- Temporary/one-time use
- Environments where you don't want to modify shell configuration

### Installing Completion on Linux

#### For Bash

1. Generate the completion script to a standard location:

```shell
wanaku completion generate --output /etc/bash_completion.d/wanaku_completion
```

1. Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```shell
source /etc/bash_completion.d/wanaku_completion
```

1. Reload your shell:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, for user-specific installation:

```shell
wanaku completion generate --output ~/.wanaku_completion
echo "source ~/.wanaku_completion" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### For Zsh

1. Generate the completion script:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
wanaku completion generate --output ~/.zsh/completions/_wanaku
```

1. Add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
source ~/.zsh/completions/_wanaku
```

1. Reload your shell:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Installing Completion on macOS

#### For Zsh (Default on macOS Catalina and later)

1. Generate the completion script:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
wanaku completion generate --output ~/.zsh/completions/_wanaku
```

1. Add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
source ~/.zsh/completions/_wanaku
```

1. Reload your shell:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### For Bash (If using bash on macOS)

1. Generate the completion script:

```shell
wanaku completion generate --output /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/wanaku
```

1. Add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```shell
source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/wanaku
```

1. Reload your shell:

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Using Shell Completion

Once installed, you can use tab-completion with the Wanaku CLI:

```shell
# Tab-complete commands
wanaku <TAB>
# Shows: capabilities, completion, forwards, man, namespaces, resources, start, tools, toolset

# Tab-complete subcommands
wanaku namespaces <TAB>
# Shows: label, list

# Tab-complete options
wanaku tools list --<TAB>
# Shows: --help, --host, --plain, --verbose

# Tab-complete after partial input
wanaku name<TAB>
# Completes to: wanaku namespaces
```

### Troubleshooting

If completion doesn't work after installation:

1. **Verify the script was sourced:** Check that your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`) contains the source command and was reloaded.

2. **Check shell detection:** The completion script automatically detects whether you're using bash or zsh. Verify you're using a supported shell:

   ```shell
   echo $BASH_VERSION  # For bash
   echo $ZSH_VERSION   # For zsh
   ```

3. **Manually source the script:** Try sourcing the completion script directly:

   ```shell
   source ~/.wanaku_completion
   ```

4. **Regenerate the script:** If you've updated Wanaku and new commands aren't appearing, regenerate the completion script:

   ```shell
   wanaku completion generate --output ~/.wanaku_completion
   source ~/.wanaku_completion
   ```

### Limitations

- **PowerShell:** Shell completion is not currently supported for PowerShell on Windows. Users on Windows should use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with bash or zsh for completion support.
- **Fish shell:** Fish shell is not supported by picocli 4.7.7. Only bash and zsh are supported.

## Understanding URIs

Universal Resource Identifiers (URI) are central to Wanaku.

They are used to define the location of resources, the tool invocation request that Wanaku will receive from the Agent/LLM and
the location of configuration and secret properties.

Understanding URIs is critical to leverage Wanaku and create flexible definitions of tools and resources.

### Flexible Input Data

Some services may require a more flexible definition of input data.

For instance, consider HTTP endpoints with dynamic parameters:

- `http://my-host/api/{someId}`
- `http://my-host/api/{someId}/create`
- `http://my-host/api/{someId}/link/to/{anotherId}`

In cases where the service cannot predetermine the actual tool addresses, users must define them when creating the tool.

### Creating URIs

Building the URIs is not always as simple as defining their address. Sometimes, optional parameters need to be filtered out or
query parameters need to be built. To help with that, Wanaku comes with a couple of expressions to build them.

To access the values, you can use the expression `{parameter.value('name')}`. For instance, to get the value of the parameter `id`
you would use the expression `{parameter.value('id')}`. You can also provide default values if none are provided, such as
`http://my-host/{parameter.valueOrElse('id', 1)}/data` (this would provide the value `1` if the parameter `id` is not set).

It is also possible to build the query part of URIs with the `query` method. For instance, to create a URI such as `http://my-host/data?id=456`
you could use `http://my-host/data{parameter.query('id')}`. If the `id` parameter is not provided, this would generate a URI such as
`http://my-host/data`. This can take multiple parameters, so it is possible to pass extra variables such as
`{parameter.query('id', 'name', 'location', ...)}`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not provide the `?` character.
> It is added automatically the parsing code if necessary.

Building the query part of URIs can be quite complex if there are too many. To avoid that, you can use `{parameter.query}` to build
a query composed of all query parameters.

The values for the queries will be automatically encoded, so a URI defined as `http://my-host/{parameter.query('id', 'name')}`
would generate `http://my-host/?id=456&name=My+Name+With+Spaces` if provided with a name value of `"My Name With Spaces"`.

### Dealing with Request Bodies

The `wanaku_body` property is a special argument used to indicate that the associated property or argument should be included in
the body of the data exchange, rather than as a parameter.

For instance, in an HTTP call, `wanaku_body` specifies that the property should be part of the HTTP body, not the HTTP URI.

The handling of such parameters may vary depending on the service being used.

### Passing Metadata as Headers

The `wanaku_meta_` prefix is a special argument prefix that allows AI services to inject headers into tool invocations
without requiring changes to the tool's configuration or route definition.

Arguments with this prefix are:

1. Extracted from the regular arguments (they are not passed to the tool as arguments)
2. Stripped of the `wanaku_meta_` prefix
3. Forwarded as headers in the tool invocation request

For example, an argument named `wanaku_meta_contextId` with value `ctx-123` becomes a header with key `contextId` and
value `ctx-123`.

This is useful for passing context information (such as user IDs, session IDs, or correlation IDs) from the AI service
through to the downstream capability service.

#### Example: LangChain4j AI Service

```java
@RegisterAiService
public interface MyService {
    @McpToolBox("toolbox")
    String callTool(
        @Header("wanaku_meta_contextId") String contextId,
        @Header("wanaku_meta_userId") String userId,
        @UserMessage String message
    );
}
```

In the tool implementation, these become accessible as headers in the `ToolInvokeRequest`:

```java
Map<String, String> headers = request.getHeadersMap();
String contextId = headers.get("contextId");  // prefix stripped
String userId = headers.get("userId");
```

> [!NOTE]
> If a metadata header has the same name as a tool-defined header (from the tool's schema), the tool-defined header
> takes precedence.

### Passing Authentication Tokens as Headers

The `wanaku_auth_` prefix is a special argument prefix that allows MCP clients to propagate access tokens or other
credentials to downstream capabilities without exposing them to LLMs.

Arguments with this prefix are:

1. Extracted from the regular arguments (they are never passed to LLMs or to the tool as arguments)
2. Stripped of the `wanaku_auth_` prefix
3. Forwarded as headers in the tool invocation request
4. Always redacted in logs and observability events

For example, an argument named `wanaku_auth_Authorization` with value `Bearer token-123` becomes a header with key
`Authorization` and value `Bearer token-123`.

This is useful for propagating access tokens from MCP clients through to downstream capabilities (HTTP, Camel, etc.)
when calling protected third-party APIs.

#### Security Guarantees

Unlike `wanaku_meta_`, authentication arguments have stricter security handling:

- **Never exposed to LLMs** — filtered from tool arguments before any processing
- **Never appear in events** — filtered from observability event arguments
- **Always redacted in headers** — sensitive header names (e.g., `Authorization`) are redacted in event headers
- **Highest merge priority** — auth headers override both metadata and tool-defined headers on conflict

#### Example: HTTP Capability with Protected API

To call a protected third-party API (e.g., GitHub), the MCP client passes the access token via `wanaku_auth_`:

```text
Arguments from MCP client:
  wanaku_auth_Authorization = "Bearer ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  owner = "octocat"
  repo = "hello-world"
```

The `wanaku_auth_Authorization` argument is extracted and becomes an `Authorization` header on the outgoing HTTP
request, while `owner` and `repo` are passed as regular tool arguments.

#### Example: Multiple Auth Tokens

Multiple auth tokens can be propagated simultaneously:

```text
Arguments from MCP client:
  wanaku_auth_Authorization = "Bearer internal-token"
  wanaku_auth_X-Third-Party-Token = "external-token"
```

Both are extracted and forwarded as separate headers to the downstream capability.

### Reserved Argument Names

Currently special arguments:

- `wanaku_body` - Indicates the argument should be included in the request body
- `wanaku_meta_` - Prefix for arguments that are converted to headers (e.g., `wanaku_meta_contextId`)
- `wanaku_auth_` - Prefix for sensitive authentication arguments that are converted to headers with redaction (e.g., `wanaku_auth_Authorization`)

## Extending Wanaku: Adding Your Own Capabilities

Wanaku leverages [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org) to provide connectivity to a vast
range of services and platforms.

Although we aim to provide a few of them out-of-the box, not all of them will fit all the use cases. For most cases, users
should rely on the [Camel Integration Capability for Wanaku](https://wanaku.ai/docs/camel-integration-capability/). That capability
service leverages Apache Camel which offers more than 300 components capable of talking to any type of system. Users can design
their integrations using tools such as [Kaoto](https://kaoto.io/) or Karavan and expose the routes as tools or resources using
that capability service.

### Adding a New Resource Provider Capability

For cases where the [Camel Integration Capability for Wanaku](https://wanaku.ai/docs/camel-integration-capability/) is
not sufficient, users can create their own capability services.

We try to make it simple for users to create custom services that solve their particular needs.

#### Creating a New Resource Provider

To create a custom resource provider, you can run:

```shell
wanaku capabilities create resource --name y4
```

To run the newly created service enter the directory that was created (i.e.,; `cd wanaku-provider-y4`),
then build the project using Maven (`mvn clean package`).

> [!NOTE]
> Capabilities services are created, by default, using [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org). However, it is possible to create
> purely Quarkus-based capabilities using the option `--type=quarkus`.

Then, launch it using:

```shell
java -Dwanaku.service.registration.uri=http://localhost:8080 -Dquarkus.http.port=9901 ... -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

You can check if the service was registered correctly using `wanaku capabilities list`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to set the parameters in the `application.properties` file and also adjust the authentication settings.

#### Adjusting Your Resource Capability

After created, then most of the work is to adjust the auto-generated `Delegate` class to provide the Camel-based URI and, if
necessary, coerce (convert) the response from its specific type to String.

### Adding a New Tool Invoker Capability

#### Creating a New Tool Service

To create a custom tool service, you can run:

```shell
wanaku capabilities create tool --name jms
```

> [!NOTE]
> Capabilities services are created, by default, using [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org). However, it is possible to create
> purely Quarkus-based capabilities using the option `--type=quarkus`.

To run the newly created service enter the directory that was created (i.e.,; `cd wanaku-tool-service-jms`), then build the project using Maven (`mvn clean package`).

Then, launch it using:

```shell
java -Dwanaku.service.registration.uri=http://localhost:8080 -Dquarkus.http.port=9900 ... -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

You can check if the service was registered correctly using `wanaku capabilities list`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to set the parameters in the `application.properties` file and also adjust the authentication settings.

To customize your service, adjust the delegate and client classes.

#### Adjusting Your Tool Invoker Capability

After created, then most of the work is to adjust the auto-generated `Delegate` and `Client` classes to invoke the service and
provide the returned response.

In those cases, then you also need to write a class that leverages [Apache Camel's](http://camel.apache.org) `ProducerTemplate`
and (or, sometimes, both) `ConsumerTemplate` to interact with the system you are implementing connectivity to.

### Adding a New Mcp server Capability

#### Creating a New Mcp server

To create a custom mcp server, you can run:

```shell
wanaku capabilities create mcp --name s3
```

To run the newly created service enter the directory that was created (i.e.,; `cd wanaku-mcp-servers-s3`),
then build the project using Maven (`mvn clean package`).

> [!NOTE]
> Capabilities services are created, by default, using [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org). However, it is possible to create
> purely Quarkus-based capabilities using the option `--type=quarkus`.

Then, launch it using:

```shell
java -Dwanaku.service.registration.uri=http://localhost:8080 -Dquarkus.http.port=9901 ... -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

You can check if the service was registered correctly using `wanaku forwards list`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to set the parameters in the `application.properties` file.

#### Adjusting Your Mcp server Capability

After created, then most of the work is to adjust the auto-generated `Tool` class to implement the mcp server tool.

### Implementing Services in Other Languages

Wanaku uses MCP for communication between the router and capability services.
Therefore, it's possible to implement capabilities in any language that supports MCP.

<!-- -->

### Adjusting the announcement address

You can adjust the address used to announce to the MCP Router using either (depending on whether using a tool or a resource provider):

- `wanaku.service.registration.announce-address=my-host`

This is particularly helpful when running a capability service in the cloud, behind a proxy or firewall.

### Adjusting the authentication parameters

- `quarkus.oidc-client.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8543/realms/${auth.realm}` (realm defaults to `wanaku`; configure via `AUTH_REALM`)
- `quarkus.oidc-client.client-id=wanaku-service`
- `quarkus.oidc-client.refresh-token-time-skew=1m`
- `quarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret=<insert key here>`

## Supported/Tested Clients

Wanaku implements the MCP protocol and, by definition, should support any client that is compliant to the protocol.

The details below describe how Wanaku MCP router can be used with some prominent MCP clients:

### Embedded LLMChat for testing

Wanaku Console includes simple LLMChat specifically designed for quick testing of the tools.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment, the Embedded LLMChat supports only the tools.

```shell
open http://localhost:8080
```

![Embedded LLMChat for testing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a80aacd-0da8-435b-8cd9-75cc073dfc79)

1. Setup LLM - `baseurl`, `api key`, `model`, and extra parameters
2. Select tools
3. Enter prompt and send

### Creating New MCP Server Using Maven

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the maven way, please make sure to adjust the version of Wanaku
> to be used by correctly setting the `wanaku-version` property to the base Wanaku version to use.

### Adjusting the MCP Server

After creating the mcp server, open the `pom.xml` file to add the dependencies for your project.
Using the example above, we would include the following dependencies:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-quarkus-aws-s3</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

Adjust the port in the `application.properties` file by adjusting the `quarkus.http.port` property.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also provide the port when launching
> (i.e., `java -Dquarkus.http.port=9190 -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`)

Then, build the project:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

And run it:

```shell
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

### Claude

You can let the CLI generate the Claude Desktop configuration for you:

```shell
wanaku configure claude
```

This updates the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and configures Claude Desktop to connect directly to Wanaku via HTTP.
If your Wanaku server is exposing streamable HTTP instead of SSE, use `--transport http`.

```claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wanaku": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Cursor can connect directly to Wanaku over HTTP or SSE. The CLI will update the Cursor MCP config for you:

```shell
wanaku configure cursor --transport http --port 8080
```

Cursor stores its global MCP config in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and the command will merge the `wanaku` entry without removing existing servers.

### HyperChat

Wanaku works with [HyperChat](https://github.com/BigSweetPotatoStudio/HyperChat). To do so,
you can configure Wanaku as an MCP server using the MCP configuration as shown below:

![Screenshot of HyperChat configuration panel showing MCP server connection settings with Wanaku router URL](imgs/hyperchat-configuration.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to have Wanaku up and running before configuring HyperChat. You may also need to
> close and reopen HyperChat.

After configuring HyperChat, you may need to go the Main Window and edit any existing agent if you have any.
Then, in the agent configuration Window, in the `allowMCPs` option, make sure you mark Wanaku as an allowed MCP server. If in
doubt, check the HyperChat project documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> Older versions of HyperChat (pre 1.1.13) required manually editing the `mcp.json` file as described on the
> [improvement ticket](https://github.com/BigSweetPotatoStudio/HyperChat/issues/30). This is not necessary
> for newer versions.

### LibreChat

For [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/docs) search for `mcpServers` on the `librechat.yml` file and include something similar to this:

```yaml
mcpServers:
    everything:
        url: http://host.docker.internal:8080/mcp/sse
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to point to the correct address of your Wanaku MCP instance.

In LibreChat, you can access Wanaku MCP tools using [Agents](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/features/agents).

### Witsy

We also have tested Wanaku with [Witsy - AI Desktop Assistant](https://github.com/nbonamy/witsy/).

### Using an STDIO gateway

Wanaku does not support stdio.
Therefore, to use Wanaku with to use it with tools that don't support SSE, it is
necessary to use an stdio-to-SSE gateway.
The application [super gateway](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway) can be used for this.

```shell
npx -y supergateway --sse http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse
```

## Available Resources and Tools

> [!NOTE]
> Most users should rely on the [Camel Integration Capability for Wanaku](https://wanaku.ai/docs/camel-integration-capability/) to create tools and resources. For custom implementations beyond Camel's connectivity, you can use the [Wanaku Capabilities Java SDK](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku-capabilities-java-sdk).

### API Note

All CLI commands use the Wanaku management API under the hood. If you need more advanced functionality or want to automate tasks, you may be able to use this API directly.

By using these CLI commands, you can manage resources and tools for your Wanaku MCP Router instance.

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> If you are setting up Wanaku for the first time, see the [First-Run Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for the most common setup issues (authentication, service registration, Docker Compose, SDK, and deployment).

This section provides solutions to common issues you may encounter while using Wanaku.

### Authentication Issues

#### Cannot authenticate with the router

**Symptoms:**

- CLI commands fail with authentication errors
- Web UI redirects to Keycloak but login fails

**Solutions:**

1. Verify Keycloak is running and accessible:

   ```shell
   curl http://localhost:8543/health
   ```

2. Check that the Keycloak realm is properly configured:
   - Ensure the `wanaku` realm exists
   - Verify the `wanaku-mcp-router` client is configured
   - Confirm user accounts have been created

3. Clear stored credentials and re-authenticate:

   ```shell
   rm ~/.wanaku/credentials
   wanaku auth login \
     --auth-server http://localhost:8080 \
     --username alice \
     --password
   ```

4. Verify the router can reach Keycloak:
   - Check the `auth.server` configuration property
   - Ensure network connectivity between components

#### Token expired errors

**Symptoms:**

- Commands work initially but fail after some time
- Error messages about expired tokens

**Solutions:**

1. Re-authenticate with the router:

   ```shell
   wanaku auth login \
     --auth-server http://localhost:8080 \
     --username alice \
     --password
   ```

2. Check token lifetime settings in Keycloak if tokens expire too quickly

### Service Registration Issues

#### Capability services not appearing in the router

**Symptoms:**

- Services start successfully but don't show up in `wanaku capabilities list`
- Tools or resources from a service are not available

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the service registration configuration:

   ```shell
   # In the capability service application.properties
   wanaku.service.registration.enabled=true
   wanaku.service.registration.uri=http://localhost:8080
   ```

2. Check service logs for registration errors:

   ```shell
   # Look for registration-related errors
   grep -i "registration" /path/to/service.log
   ```

3. Verify network connectivity between the service and router:

   ```shell
   # From the service host
   curl http://localhost:8080/q/health
   ```

4. Check if the service is using the correct OIDC credentials:
   - Verify `quarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret` matches the secret in Keycloak
   - Ensure the `wanaku-service` client exists in Keycloak

5. Check the router backend logs for incoming registration requests

#### Service shows as "offline" or "unhealthy"

**Symptoms:**

- Service appears in `wanaku capabilities list` but marked as offline
- Intermittent availability

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the service is running:

   ```shell
   # Check if the port is listening
   netstat -an | grep 9009
   ```

2. Check the registration interval and ensure heartbeats are being sent:

   ```shell
   # In application.properties
   wanaku.service.registration.interval=10s
   ```

3. Review service health and ensure it's not crashing or restarting

### Connection Issues

#### Cannot connect to the router from MCP clients

**Symptoms:**

- MCP clients fail to connect
- Timeout errors when connecting

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the router is running and accessible:

   ```shell
   curl http://localhost:8080/q/health
   ```

2. Check the correct MCP endpoint is being used:
   - SSE transport: `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse`
   - Streamable HTTP: `http://localhost:8080/mcp/`

3. For namespace-specific connections, ensure the correct path:

   ```shell
   # For namespace ns-1
   http://localhost:8080/ns-1/mcp/sse
   ```

4. Verify firewall rules allow traffic on port 8080

5. Check CORS settings if connecting from a web application:

   ```shell
   quarkus.http.cors.enabled=true
   quarkus.http.cors.origins=http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Tool and Resource Issues

#### Tools or resources not appearing in MCP clients

**Symptoms:**

- `wanaku tools list` shows tools, but they don't appear in the MCP client
- Resources are registered but not accessible

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the tool/resource is in the correct namespace:

   ```shell
   wanaku tools list
   wanaku namespaces list
   ```

2. Check if the client is connected to the correct namespace endpoint

3. Refresh the MCP client connection

4. Verify the capability service providing the tool is online:

   ```shell
   wanaku capabilities list
   ```

#### Tool invocation fails

**Symptoms:**

- Tool appears in client but execution fails
- Error messages when calling a tool

**Solutions:**

1. Check the tool URI is correct:

   ```shell
   wanaku tools list
   ```

2. Verify the capability service is running and healthy

3. Review capability service logs for errors during tool execution

4. Ensure required configuration or secrets are properly set:

   ```shell
   wanaku tools list
   ```

5. For HTTP tools, verify the target endpoint is accessible from the service

#### Resource read fails

**Symptoms:**

- Resource appears but cannot be read
- Empty or error responses when accessing resources

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the resource URI and that the target exists:

   ```shell
   wanaku resources list
   ```

2. Check file permissions if using file-based resources

3. Verify network access if using remote resources (S3, FTP, etc.)

4. Review provider service logs for errors

### Build and Deployment Issues

#### Build fails with missing dependencies

**Symptoms:**

- Maven build errors
- Missing artifact errors

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure you're using the correct Maven version:

   ```shell
   mvn --version  # Should be 3.x
   ```

2. Clear Maven cache and rebuild:

   ```shell
   rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/ai/wanaku
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Verify internet connectivity for downloading dependencies

#### Native build fails

**Symptoms:**

- Native compilation errors
- GraalVM-related failures

**Solutions:**

1. Verify GraalVM is properly installed:

   ```shell
   java -version  # Should show GraalVM
   native-image --version
   ```

2. Check the [Quarkus native build guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image) for system requirements

3. Try building without native mode first to isolate the issue:

   ```shell
   mvn clean package
   ```

#### Container deployment fails

**Symptoms:**

- Pods in CrashLoopBackOff state
- ImagePullBackOff errors

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the container image exists and is accessible:

   ```shell
   podman pull quay.io/wanaku/wanaku-barn-backend:latest
   ```

2. Check pod logs for startup errors:

   ```shell
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

3. Verify ConfigMaps and Secrets are properly mounted:

   ```shell
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

4. Check resource limits and ensure sufficient memory/CPU

5. Verify Keycloak is accessible from the pods:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec <pod-name> -- curl http://keycloak:8080/health
   ```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow response times

**Symptoms:**

- Tools take a long time to execute
- Resource reads are slow
- MCP clients experience timeouts

**Solutions:**

1. Check router and service resource usage:

   ```shell
   top
   htop
   ```

2. Review logs for errors or warnings

3. Verify network latency between components:

   ```shell
   ping <service-host>
   ```

4. Check Infinispan cache performance and consider adjusting:

   ```shell
   wanaku.infinispan.max-state-count=10
   ```

5. For Kubernetes deployments, ensure adequate resource limits:

   ```yaml
   resources:
     requests:
       memory: "512Mi"
       cpu: "500m"
     limits:
       memory: "1Gi"
       cpu: "1000m"
   ```

### Logging and Debugging

#### Enable debug logging

To get more detailed logs for troubleshooting:

**Router backend:**

```properties
quarkus.log.level=DEBUG
quarkus.log.category."ai.wanaku".level=DEBUG
quarkus.mcp.server.traffic-logging.enabled=true
```

**Capability services:**

```properties
quarkus.log.level=DEBUG
quarkus.log.category."ai.wanaku".level=DEBUG
```

**CLI:**

```shell
wanaku --verbose tools list
```

To produce clean, parsable output without ANSI colors or escape sequences (useful for scripting and piping):

```shell
wanaku tools list --plain
```

#### Access logs

Check logs in these locations:

- **Router backend:** Look for `wanaku-barn-backend.log` or check container logs
- **Capability services:** Check individual service log files
- **Kubernetes:** `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
